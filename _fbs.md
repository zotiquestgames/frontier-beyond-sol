# Frontier: Beyond Sol

Under the ghostly glow of SZ Ursae Majoris’ seventh planet, a cold martian giant, the small, stealthy vessel *Nimbus* held its position, nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding space debris. Inside, a team of Sol Union operatives prepared for a mission that tread the line between diplomacy and covert action in the uncharted reaches of space.

“Visuals up. We’re going in silent, but ready for anything,” Captain Elena Reyes instructed, her voice calm but carrying an undercurrent of anticipation. The *Nimbus* was a shadow against the planet’s icy rings, ready to deploy its team to a hidden base suspected of harboring technology that could shift the power dynamics within the Union.

Zan, her second-in-command, scanned the data streaming on his screen. “Approach vector locked. We’re ghosting through their scanners.”

In the dim light of the command deck, Ila, their communications and tech expert, piped up, “Jamming signals ready. We’ll be in and out before they know it.”

Elena nodded, turning to the rest of her crew. “This isn’t just about the tech. It’s about sending a message. We do this right, we could be paving the way for a new era of cooperation — or confrontation.”

Tarek, the team’s engineer, adjusted his gear, a mix of excitement and focus on his face. “Let’s make sure it’s cooperation then. I didn’t tweak these suits for nothing.”

A soft chuckle ran through the crew, easing the tension. Lian, who had been studying the planet’s atmospheric readings, added, “Remember, we’re not just operatives. We’re ambassadors. Every action reflects on the Sol Union.”

As the *Nimbus* neared the drop point, Elena shared a final glance with her team. “We all know the stakes. Let’s show them what the Sol Union stands for.”

The operatives moved towards the airlock, their suits equipped with the latest in stealth and environmental technology. As the outer door opened, revealing the vast, silent expanse of space, Zan muttered under his breath, a hint of humor in his voice, “Ambassadors with style, at least.”

One by one, they stepped into the void, their figures swallowed by the darkness as they made their silent approach to the hidden base, a speck of light against the infinite canvas of space.

# What is Frontier: Beyond Sol

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is a roleplaying game in which you will define an imagined space bounded by rules. Actions and events occur through procedure-driven player interaction. This facilitates an emergent shared narrative.

Put plainly, players will assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. The characters will act according to the rules of the game that will guarantee their success or failure. The outcome of actions will have an effect on the narrative that emerges.

A game of *Frontier: Beyond Sol* takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the other players.

  - The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing Characters.
  - The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out their Character or play them impersonally. Players should also ask questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:

  - At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal number of players is 4-5 players, maximum 6.
  - A complete set of polyhedral dice, preferably one for each player.
  - Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the following principles in mind:

  - **Fiction over mechanics.** This ruleset is intentionally streamlined and prioritizes fiction over complex mechanics. If you are primarily interested in a game with detailed mechanical systems, there are other rulesets that may be better suited to your preferences.
  - **The Referee is a player.** Although the Referee has different responsibilities than the other players, they should still be considered as a fellow player and should not shoulder more responsibility for the success of the game than anyone else at the table.
  - **Referee’s Mediating Role.** The Referee does not compete against other players; their role is solely to arbitrate situations within the context of the game. They are responsible for maintaining consistency, ensuring fairness, and resolving any disputes or conflicts that may arise during play.
  - **Promote Cooperative Play.** This game is intended to be played collaboratively, with a focus on teamwork and overcoming challenges as a group. As such, competition between players should be discouraged in favor of cooperation and mutual support. The characters should work together to confront the obstacles and threats posed by the game world, rather than engaging in individualistic or adversarial behavior.
  - **Information Query.** Players should ask the Referee questions in a concise and straightforward manner. The Referee, in turn, should provide clear and detailed explanations of the context and the potential risks associated with each action taken by the characters. This helps to ensure that players make informed decisions and understand the consequences of their actions.
  - **Action first.** When describing an action, players should first provide a clear and detailed description of what their character is attempting to do. Only after the action has been fully described should the Referee request a dice roll, if necessary, to determine the outcome of the action. This helps to ensure that the narrative flows smoothly and that players have a clear understanding of the sequence of events.
  - **Emergent Fiction.** The game thrives on emergent fiction, where the narrative evolves naturally from player choices and interactions. Be prepared for unexpected twists and developments, and allow the story to unfold organically based on the characters’ actions and decisions. Embrace the creativity and spontaneity that arise from collaborative storytelling, and don’t be afraid to deviate from preconceived notions of how the plot should progress.
  - **Embrace uncertainty.** Embracing uncertainty is at the core of this game. Embrace the unpredictability of player choices and the twists and turns the narrative may take. Avoid rigidly planning every detail and be open to adapting to the unexpected. This willingness to embrace uncertainty can lead to some of the most memorable and engaging moments in the game, so relish the uncertainty and let it guide the storytelling.

## A word about “realism”

In playing *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, it is important to embrace a sense of realism that remains consistent with the game’s setting, backgrounds, equipment, and accompanying illustrations. This hard sci-fi universe is designed to inspire players and immerse them in a believable and captivating experience. While it is not mandatory to have prior knowledge of the specific science fiction genre or to read the sources of inspiration, doing so can deepen the appreciation for the game’s intricacies. While true “realism” is impossible in a fictional game, it is crucial to avoid indulging in absurdities and instead strive for consistency with the established setting and adhere to general principles of physics. By embracing this approach, players can engage in an authentic and immersive gaming experience that respects the established rules and allows for a compelling and plausible narrative to unfold.

## Safety Tools

It is important to remember that not everyone at the table may be comfortable with the themes or content addressed by the game, or with the actions of the other players. It is therefore important to establish clear boundaries and expectations at the beginning of the game, and to be sensitive to the needs and feelings of all participants throughout the session. It may also be helpful to establish a system for communicating discomfort or taking breaks if needed.

There are various safety tools and techniques that can help create a comfortable and safe environment for everyone involved in the game, such as [Lines And Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean), [C.A.T.S.](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/), the [X-Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit?usp=sharing), and [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/).

It is important to familiarize yourself with these tools and techniques and to use them proactively to ensure that everyone feels safe and comfortable during the game.

# How to play

The role of the Referee is to control the game universe: he describes situations, NPCs, and their reactions to the PCs’ actions. He or she should be as clear as possible about the conditions of the context in which the characters are immersed: if there is a reasonable certainty that the character has access to a piece of information or knowledge, the referee should communicate it to the player, without asking for a roll. In this game, a roll is made only for situations of risk or uncertainty of the outcome of a direct action.

  - If an action is impossible, the referee simply declares it so by explaining why and describing the possible alternatives to the player.
  - If the cost of an action is explicit, the referee will clearly present it. The player can decide whether to take the action or try another one.
  - If the action involves a risk, the referee will communicate this clearly. The player will be able to make informed decisions about the action they want to take and they will pull to determine the outcome.

In all other cases, the action is automatically successful.

## Rolling

When a character attempts an action with significant risk, the player rolls a skill die to determine the outcome. The default is a d6.

  - If the character has applicable skills or talents, they roll a bigger die like d8 or d10 to represent competence.
  - Conversely, if *hindered* by injuries or obstacles may warrant a smaller die like d4 to show impairment.

The player can also roll bonus dice based on circumstances:

  - Favorable conditions grant an extra d6 die. Things like having the high ground in combat or proper tools for a repair task.
  - An ally who helps adds their own skill die to the roll, representing combined effort. The ally shares in any risk.

The player rolls their skill die plus any bonus dice, taking the single highest result.

  - **1-2, disaster.** The full brunt of the risk occurs, and the Referee judges if there is any success at all. A roll this bad could mean instant death when mortality is on the line.
  - **3-4, setback.** You suffer a lesser or partial consequence. If risking death, the character might survive but with a grievous injury and *hindered*.
  - **5+, success.** The higher numbers, the better the outcomes.

The core mechanic balances risk versus reward, with competence and teamwork aiding success. But dire consequences are still possible, maintaining high drama and tension.

## Load

Characters can carry as many possessions as reasonably fits their physical capacity and the storage space on their person. For example, a character could carry a weapon, some tools, and a backpack containing rations and other useful adventuring gear.

However, if a character loads themselves down with multiple overly bulky or heavy items, it may hinder their ability to move and act freely at times. For instance, carrying a large shield, a two-handed weapon, and a bulging sack of gear may make it difficult to squeeze through narrow spaces or balance while climbing.

In such cases, the referee will inform the player that their character’s encumbrance is \_hindering \_their movement or dexterity in the current situation. The player can then decide to temporarily set down some of their carried items to proceed unfettered, stowing the extra gear nearby to be retrieved later. Or they may opt to continue carrying everything, accepting additional challenges or risks to their intended actions.

## Advancement

After successfully completing a mission or major story milestone, each player character will improve in the following ways as a reward for their accomplishments:

  - Increase one of their skill ranks by one step on the progression track (none → d8 → d10 → d12). This represents honing their competencies through experience.
  - Gain a number of currency credits (₡) equal to a d6 roll. Credits can be spent to acquire new gear, weapons, cyberware, services, etc. The die roll result encourages uncertainty in the exact amount of new wealth obtained.

For example, after infiltrating an enemy base undetected and stealing valuable data, a character with stealth and hacking skills currently at d8 could increase their stealth to d10 for greater sneaking ability. They also would gain somewhere between 1-6 credits to spend on desired upgrades and purchases.

This dual progression system rewards both new capabilities and resources, allowing characters to become more powerful and versatile over the course of the campaign. The incremental upgrades create a satisfying sense of growth and advancement for each successful mission. But the unpredictability keeps material gain uncertain, maintaining long-term goals and motivation.

## Damage Control

Say how you use a piece of gear to absorb damage. It’s disabled until repaired at a base.

When a character is about to take damage from an attack or hazard, the player can describe how they utilize a piece of equipment to absorb some or all of the incoming damage. This could involve actions like raising a shield to block an incoming blow, using a large tool as cover from an explosion, or angling a vehicle to have an attack hit a reinforced section.

After being used to soak damage this way, that gear becomes disabled and non-functional until it can be repaired back at a home base or facility with the proper tools and parts.

The referee will determine if using the gear fully negates the attack or just reduces the damage taken. More powerful or intense attacks may overwhelm a piece of gear’s protection capacity.

## Injuries

If a character sustains a serious injury during a game session, they will need to spend some in-game time in the medical bay to recover. The player should describe their character receiving medical treatment and the referee can narrate the passage of time during the healing process.

If a character is killed, the player should introduce a new character as soon as is practical. The referee should facilitate quickly integrating the new character into the ongoing story.

When adjudicating the effects of injuries or character death, inclusion of the affected player takes priority over adhering to strict realism. The referee should aim to avoid excluding a player from participation due to their character being incapacitated. Workarounds like having the player take temporary control of a supporting character can help keep everyone involved.

The risks of combat and other dangerous activities are an important part of the game’s drama and stakes. However, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have fun together. So when serious consequences occur, the referee should guide the narrative in a direction that returns the affected player to active participation in a seamless, collaborative manner.

## Game mastering

The referee portrays non-player characters (NPCs) by describing their behaviors, motivations, and obstacles they present to the player characters. The referee should lead the group in establishing boundaries for subject matter and conduct during play.

To control pacing and safety, the referee can fast-forward through uneventful stretches, pause play for breaks or sidebar discussions, or even rewind and redo a scene if needed. The referee should invite players to request scene edits too.

The referee should present dilemmas and challenges without pre-planned solutions, allowing the players to drive the direction of the story through their choices.

To give everyone screen time, the referee moves the spotlight around, checking in with each player in turn.

To inject randomness and chaos, the referee can occasionally test for bad luck by rolling a die - a 1-2 means trouble occurs, like running out of ammo at a bad time or stumbling into patrolling guards. A 3-4 indicates signs of impending trouble.

When the written rules don’t adequately cover a situation, the referee improvises rulings in the moment to keep the game moving. If any rulings seem unsatisfactory, the group should discuss them on a break and revise them collaboratively.

The referee portrays the world and inhabitants surrounding the player characters. By sharing narrative power while guiding pacing and monitoring safety, the referee enables the group to collectively build an exciting and satisfying story.

## Playing Solo

In a solo role-playing game, use these steps to guide your scenes:

1.  **Set Expectations:** Think about your character’s traits, goals, and motivations. Picture their action and how the game world might respond.  
2.  **Test Expectations:** If you’re unsure how the world reacts, ask the oracle a “Yes” or “No” question to gauge possible outcomes—advantages or setbacks.  
3.  **Interpret the Outcome:** Compare the oracle’s answer to your expectations. If it matches, proceed as planned. If it doesn’t, think about how the unexpected result could shift the scene or story.

Testing your assumptions keeps the game engaging and opens up fresh story possibilities.

When deciding outcomes for actions beyond your character’s control or answering questions about the game world or NPC (Non-Player Character) reactions, try one of these methods:

1.  **Draw a Conclusion:** Choose the answer that’s the most interesting or logical.  
2.  **Ask a Closed Question:** Estimate the odds of a “Yes,” then roll on the table below for the answer.  
3.  **Choose Between Two Options:** Imagine two possible outcomes, mark one as “likely,” and roll to see if it’s true. If not, go with the other option.  
4.  **Spark an Idea:** Brainstorm or use a random prompt (like the Omen tables or other generators in Part III).

### Asking Questions

For closed questions (with a “Yes” or “No” answer), follow these steps:

1.  Roll a die based on the likelihood:

| Likelihood    | Die to Roll |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Very Unlikely | 1d4         |
| Unlikely      | 1d6         |
| Uncertain     | 1d6         |
| Likely        | 1d10        |
| Very Likely   | 1d12        |

2.  Interpret the roll:
      - **1-2 No, and…**: What you expected doesn’t happen, and things get worse.  
      - **3-4 Yes, but…**: What you expected happens, but with a complication.  
      - **5+ Yes, and…**: What you expected happens, plus something even better\!
3.  Think about the answer in the context of your question and the situation. Does it fit? Does it inspire you?  
4.  If you’ve got your answer, great\! Play it out. If you need more details, use the Sparks tables for inspiration.  
5.  If you’re still stuck, try rolling again, exploring a different Spark, or trust your instincts to move forward.

For open-ended questions, skip the oracle and roll directly on the Sparks tables. Let the results guide your imagination.

### Sparks

Use these tables to spark adventure ideas for *Frontier: Beyond Sol*. Combine an Action with a Theme to generate prompts like:

  - **“Investigate a signal in an uncharted star system.”**  
  - **“Defend an outpost from a hostile faction.”**  
  - **“Chart a stargate route through a debris field.”**  
  - **“Retrieve an ancient alien artifact buried in a ruin.”**

# Interstellar Travel

Interstellar travel in this universe is not only about reaching distant star systems but also about managing resources, calculating travel times through hyperspace corridors or wormholes, and facing unexpected encounters along the journey. The advanced propulsion systems and starships available offer a range of options, each with its own capabilities and limitations.

As you traverse the vastness of interstellar space, be prepared for the unexpected. Navigation hazards, random anomalies, and dangerous encounters may test your skills and decision-making. Whether negotiating with alien civilizations, repairing hyperdrives, or avoiding cosmic phenomena, your voyages will be filled with peril and wonder.

## Navigation Hazards

Navigating across interstellar distances presents unique challenges requiring precise calculations and skillful execution. Characters must navigate gravitational forces, celestial bodies, radiation hazards, and the complexities of hyperspace/wormhole travel to reach destinations safely.

During journeys, they may face:

1.  **Astrogation Challenges:** Plotting interstellar courses demands advanced astrogation accounting for factors like star locations, gravity wells, hyperspace corridors and jump points. Navigation checks determine trajectory accuracy and efficiency.

2.  **Gravity Slingshots:** Using a celestial body’s gravity can multiply a ship’s velocity. Characters must identify opportunities for gravity slingshots and execute complex maneuvers.

## Travel Time and Fuel Consumption

Interstellar travel in this universe requires careful planning and resource management. Two main methods exist - conventional interplanetary travel within star systems, and utilization of the rare and precious jumpgate technology to traverse between neighboring systems.

### Interplanetary Travel

For voyages within a single star system, spacecraft must rely on conventional propulsion technology like fusion torches and Ion engines. These provide high levels of acceleration over long periods, but are still bound by the limits of relativistic physics.

Travel times between planets in a system can take weeks or months depending on the distances involved. A trip from Earth to the orbit of Neptune in our Solar system could take over 8 months with continuous acceleration and deceleration.

Fuel requirements scale with the mass of the spacecraft and desired acceleration rates. A large cargo hauler may require thousands of tons of fuel for an interplanetary journey, while efficient exploration craft can make do with far less.

Key considerations: - Conventional interplanetary drives are reliable but sluggish - High acceleration rates are possible but consume exponentially more fuel - In-system resource extraction and refueling is often necessary - Travel times must account for months of acceleration and deceleration

### Jumpgate Technology

The pivotal invention of jumpgate technology revolutionized interstellar travel by allowing effective faster-than-light transit between star systems up to 15 light-years apart. Jumpgates are artificially sustained wormholes stabilized by rare minerals and immense industrial megastructures.

While passage through a jumpgate is nearly instantaneous, the gates themselves are incredibly rare. The handful of known stable jumpgates discovered so far connect wealthy inner spheres of human-occupied space.

Operating a jumpgate requires astronomical quantities of exotic matter and antimatter fuel sources. This ensures they remain under strict control of system authorities and powerful corporations.

Key limitations: - Only a few dozen jumpgates exist across inhabited space - Maximum range is 15 light-years between connected gates  
\- Transits are effectively instantaneous but consume huge resources - Undiscovered systems lack gate access entirely

Given the scarcity of jumpgates, most interstellar travel still relies on protracted conventional voyages at sub-light speeds. Even with gate access, in-system travel requires months of careful planning. Jumpgates are highly strategic assets, but do not fully alleviate the challenges and perils of interstellar exploration and resource logistics in this universe.

## Environmental Hazards

Environmental Hazards play a significant role in *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, emphasizing the harsh realities and challenges of space colonization. Characters will encounter a range of hazards that pose risks to their well-being and mission success. These hazards include radiation exposure, microgravity environments, extreme temperatures, and the scarcity of resources. Mechanisms are in place to address these challenges and ensure the characters’ survival and progress in the game.

### Radiation Exposure

Space is filled with various forms of radiation that can be harmful to humans and equipment. Characters must navigate through regions with higher radiation levels cautiously, utilize radiation shielding materials and equipment to minimize exposure, and monitor radiation levels to avoid long-term health effects. The Referee may introduce radiation events or zones that require characters to make decisions regarding their routes, resource allocation for shielding, or even engaging in special missions to repair or secure radiation shielding on structures or spacecraft.

### Microgravity Environments

In microgravity conditions, characters experience weightlessness, which can affect their physical capabilities and equipment. Characters must adapt to the challenges of moving, performing tasks, and manipulating objects in a microgravity environment. They may require specialized training or equipment, such as magnetic boots or handheld propulsion devices, to maintain stability and maneuver effectively. The Referee can introduce skill checks or mechanics to simulate the unique physics of microgravity, adding an additional layer of complexity to character actions and decision-making.

### Extreme Temperatures

The vastness of space brings extreme temperature variations, from freezing cold to scorching heat. Characters must prepare for these extreme temperatures by wearing appropriate environmental suits, utilizing temperature regulation systems, and ensuring proper insulation in their habitats and vehicles. Failure to manage temperature extremes can lead to equipment malfunctions, damage to life support systems, or even life-threatening conditions for characters. The Referee can introduce mechanics for monitoring temperature levels, making temperature-related skill checks, or incorporating events where characters must deal with unexpected temperature fluctuations.

### Scarcity of Resources

Resources in space are limited, and characters must face the challenges of managing and rationing essential supplies such as oxygen, water, food, and energy. The scarcity of resources adds an additional layer of tension and decision-making to the game. Characters may need to engage in resource acquisition missions, establish mining operations, or trade with other factions to secure the necessary supplies for survival and mission objectives. The Referee can implement resource management mechanics, encounters related to resource scarcity, or events that test characters’ ability to make tough choices regarding resource allocation.

### Environmental Suits and Scientific Equipment

Environmental suits provide protection against the harsh space environments, including temperature extremes, radiation, and micrometeoroids. Characters must have access to and maintain environmental suits to venture outside habitats or spacecraft. Additionally, scientific equipment such as spectrometers, telescopes, or microscopes allow characters to gather valuable data, conduct experiments, and make discoveries. These tools are essential for scientific research and can provide insights into the environment, resources, and potential threats.

# The Age of Expansion

By the late 21st century, humanity had outgrown its cradle. The solar system became our new frontier, its planets and moons transformed into battlegrounds of politics, innovation, and survival. What began as a struggle for autonomy among colonies evolved into the foundation of the Sol Union, a fragile unity in the face of the unknown.

The early experiments with wormholes cracked the door to interstellar exploration, but it was decades before the courage and technology existed to walk through it. As humanity reached new stars, it carried with it old tensions: the balance between control and freedom, preservation and exploitation. The colonies of the “frontier” grew restless, and the systems closer to Sol wrestled with their own evolving identity.

When alien ruins were discovered in 2295, they shattered the illusion that humanity was alone. Though their builders were long gone, the ruins whispered of civilizations far older and more advanced. This revelation lit a fire beneath humanity’s ambitions, pushing us further into the void—not just to settle, but to understand.

From a fragile beginning to an expanding web of stargates and alliances, this era defined what it meant to be human in a universe where the stars were no longer out of reach.

## Chronology

### 2090-2124: The Era of Solar Exploration

  - **2090**: The solar system is fully colonized. This year sees tensions arise between the solar colonies and Earth governments, leading to a phase of rebellion demanding greater autonomy for the colonies. This period of unrest culminates in the Federated Autonomy Treaty, laying the foundation for the Sol Union as a federal governing entity.
  - **2100**: Scientists begin theorizing viable methods for creating wormholes, but the risks and energy required are enormous.
  - **2115**: The first practical experiments on wormholes begin in a remote area beyond Neptune’s orbit, far from inhabited planets to minimize risks.

### 2125-2160: The Dawn of Interstellar Exploration

  - **2125**: The first “wormhole engine” is successfully experimented with, opening a temporary gateway to Alpha Centauri on an unmanned mission.

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is the direct sequel to *Sol: Beyond Earth*

CC BY-SA 4.0 \# Frontier: Beyond Sol

Under the ghostly glow of SZ Ursae Majoris’ seventh planet, a cold martian giant, the small, stealthy vessel *Nimbus* held its position, nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding space debris. Inside, a team of Sol Union operatives prepared for a mission that tread the line between diplomacy and covert action in the uncharted reaches of space.

“Visuals up. We’re going in silent, but ready for anything,” Captain Elena Reyes instructed, her voice calm but carrying an undercurrent of anticipation. The *Nimbus* was a shadow against the planet’s icy rings, ready to deploy its team to a hidden base suspected of harboring technology that could shift the power dynamics within the Union.

Zan, her second-in-command, scanned the data streaming on his screen. “Approach vector locked. We’re ghosting through their scanners.”

In the dim light of the command deck, Ila, their communications and tech expert, piped up, “Jamming signals ready. We’ll be in and out before they know it.”

Elena nodded, turning to the rest of her crew. “This isn’t just about the tech. It’s about sending a message. We do this right, we could be paving the way for a new era of cooperation — or confrontation.”

Tarek, the team’s engineer, adjusted his gear, a mix of excitement and focus on his face. “Let’s make sure it’s cooperation then. I didn’t tweak these suits for nothing.”

A soft chuckle ran through the crew, easing the tension. Lian, who had been studying the planet’s atmospheric readings, added, “Remember, we’re not just operatives. We’re ambassadors. Every action reflects on the Sol Union.”

As the *Nimbus* neared the drop point, Elena shared a final glance with her team. “We all know the stakes. Let’s show them what the Sol Union stands for.”

The operatives moved towards the airlock, their suits equipped with the latest in stealth and environmental technology. As the outer door opened, revealing the vast, silent expanse of space, Zan muttered under his breath, a hint of humor in his voice, “Ambassadors with style, at least.”

One by one, they stepped into the void, their figures swallowed by the darkness as they made their silent approach to the hidden base, a speck of light against the infinite canvas of space.

# What is Frontier: Beyond Sol

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is a roleplaying game in which you will define an imagined space bounded by rules. Actions and events occur through procedure-driven player interaction. This facilitates an emergent shared narrative.

Put plainly, players will assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. The characters will act according to the rules of the game that will guarantee their success or failure. The outcome of actions will have an effect on the narrative that emerges.

A game of *Frontier: Beyond Sol* takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the other players.

  - The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing Characters.
  - The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out their Character or play them impersonally. Players should also ask questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:

  - At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal number of players is 4-5 players, maximum 6.
  - A complete set of polyhedral dice, preferably one for each player.
  - Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the following principles in mind:

  - **Fiction over mechanics.** This ruleset is intentionally streamlined and prioritizes fiction over complex mechanics. If you are primarily interested in a game with detailed mechanical systems, there are other rulesets that may be better suited to your preferences.
  - **The Referee is a player.** Although the Referee has different responsibilities than the other players, they should still be considered as a fellow player and should not shoulder more responsibility for the success of the game than anyone else at the table.
  - **Referee’s Mediating Role.** The Referee does not compete against other players; their role is solely to arbitrate situations within the context of the game. They are responsible for maintaining consistency, ensuring fairness, and resolving any disputes or conflicts that may arise during play.
  - **Promote Cooperative Play.** This game is intended to be played collaboratively, with a focus on teamwork and overcoming challenges as a group. As such, competition between players should be discouraged in favor of cooperation and mutual support. The characters should work together to confront the obstacles and threats posed by the game world, rather than engaging in individualistic or adversarial behavior.
  - **Information Query.** Players should ask the Referee questions in a concise and straightforward manner. The Referee, in turn, should provide clear and detailed explanations of the context and the potential risks associated with each action taken by the characters. This helps to ensure that players make informed decisions and understand the consequences of their actions.
  - **Action first.** When describing an action, players should first provide a clear and detailed description of what their character is attempting to do. Only after the action has been fully described should the Referee request a dice roll, if necessary, to determine the outcome of the action. This helps to ensure that the narrative flows smoothly and that players have a clear understanding of the sequence of events.
  - **Emergent Fiction.** The game thrives on emergent fiction, where the narrative evolves naturally from player choices and interactions. Be prepared for unexpected twists and developments, and allow the story to unfold organically based on the characters’ actions and decisions. Embrace the creativity and spontaneity that arise from collaborative storytelling, and don’t be afraid to deviate from preconceived notions of how the plot should progress.
  - **Embrace uncertainty.** Embracing uncertainty is at the core of this game. Embrace the unpredictability of player choices and the twists and turns the narrative may take. Avoid rigidly planning every detail and be open to adapting to the unexpected. This willingness to embrace uncertainty can lead to some of the most memorable and engaging moments in the game, so relish the uncertainty and let it guide the storytelling.

## A word about “realism”

In playing *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, it is important to embrace a sense of realism that remains consistent with the game’s setting, backgrounds, equipment, and accompanying illustrations. This hard sci-fi universe is designed to inspire players and immerse them in a believable and captivating experience. While it is not mandatory to have prior knowledge of the specific science fiction genre or to read the sources of inspiration, doing so can deepen the appreciation for the game’s intricacies. While true “realism” is impossible in a fictional game, it is crucial to avoid indulging in absurdities and instead strive for consistency with the established setting and adhere to general principles of physics. By embracing this approach, players can engage in an authentic and immersive gaming experience that respects the established rules and allows for a compelling and plausible narrative to unfold.

## Safety Tools

It is important to remember that not everyone at the table may be comfortable with the themes or content addressed by the game, or with the actions of the other players. It is therefore important to establish clear boundaries and expectations at the beginning of the game, and to be sensitive to the needs and feelings of all participants throughout the session. It may also be helpful to establish a system for communicating discomfort or taking breaks if needed.

There are various safety tools and techniques that can help create a comfortable and safe environment for everyone involved in the game, such as [Lines And Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean), [C.A.T.S.](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/), the [X-Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit?usp=sharing), and [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/).

It is important to familiarize yourself with these tools and techniques and to use them proactively to ensure that everyone feels safe and comfortable during the game.

# How to play

The role of the Referee is to control the game universe: he describes situations, NPCs, and their reactions to the PCs’ actions. He or she should be as clear as possible about the conditions of the context in which the characters are immersed: if there is a reasonable certainty that the character has access to a piece of information or knowledge, the referee should communicate it to the player, without asking for a roll. In this game, a roll is made only for situations of risk or uncertainty of the outcome of a direct action.

  - If an action is impossible, the referee simply declares it so by explaining why and describing the possible alternatives to the player.
  - If the cost of an action is explicit, the referee will clearly present it. The player can decide whether to take the action or try another one.
  - If the action involves a risk, the referee will communicate this clearly. The player will be able to make informed decisions about the action they want to take and they will pull to determine the outcome.

In all other cases, the action is automatically successful.

## Rolling

When a character attempts an action with significant risk, the player rolls a skill die to determine the outcome. The default is a d6.

  - If the character has applicable skills or talents, they roll a bigger die like d8 or d10 to represent competence.
  - Conversely, if *hindered* by injuries or obstacles may warrant a smaller die like d4 to show impairment.

The player can also roll bonus dice based on circumstances:

  - Favorable conditions grant an extra d6 die. Things like having the high ground in combat or proper tools for a repair task.
  - An ally who helps adds their own skill die to the roll, representing combined effort. The ally shares in any risk.

The player rolls their skill die plus any bonus dice, taking the single highest result.

  - **1-2, disaster.** The full brunt of the risk occurs, and the Referee judges if there is any success at all. A roll this bad could mean instant death when mortality is on the line.
  - **3-4, setback.** You suffer a lesser or partial consequence. If risking death, the character might survive but with a grievous injury and *hindered*.
  - **5+, success.** The higher numbers, the better the outcomes.

The core mechanic balances risk versus reward, with competence and teamwork aiding success. But dire consequences are still possible, maintaining high drama and tension.

## Load

Characters can carry as many possessions as reasonably fits their physical capacity and the storage space on their person. For example, a character could carry a weapon, some tools, and a backpack containing rations and other useful adventuring gear.

However, if a character loads themselves down with multiple overly bulky or heavy items, it may hinder their ability to move and act freely at times. For instance, carrying a large shield, a two-handed weapon, and a bulging sack of gear may make it difficult to squeeze through narrow spaces or balance while climbing.

In such cases, the referee will inform the player that their character’s encumbrance is \_hindering \_their movement or dexterity in the current situation. The player can then decide to temporarily set down some of their carried items to proceed unfettered, stowing the extra gear nearby to be retrieved later. Or they may opt to continue carrying everything, accepting additional challenges or risks to their intended actions.

## Advancement

After successfully completing a mission or major story milestone, each player character will improve in the following ways as a reward for their accomplishments:

  - Increase one of their skill ranks by one step on the progression track (none → d8 → d10 → d12). This represents honing their competencies through experience.
  - Gain a number of currency credits (₡) equal to a d6 roll. Credits can be spent to acquire new gear, weapons, cyberware, services, etc. The die roll result encourages uncertainty in the exact amount of new wealth obtained.

For example, after infiltrating an enemy base undetected and stealing valuable data, a character with stealth and hacking skills currently at d8 could increase their stealth to d10 for greater sneaking ability. They also would gain somewhere between 1-6 credits to spend on desired upgrades and purchases.

This dual progression system rewards both new capabilities and resources, allowing characters to become more powerful and versatile over the course of the campaign. The incremental upgrades create a satisfying sense of growth and advancement for each successful mission. But the unpredictability keeps material gain uncertain, maintaining long-term goals and motivation.

## Damage Control

Say how you use a piece of gear to absorb damage. It’s disabled until repaired at a base.

When a character is about to take damage from an attack or hazard, the player can describe how they utilize a piece of equipment to absorb some or all of the incoming damage. This could involve actions like raising a shield to block an incoming blow, using a large tool as cover from an explosion, or angling a vehicle to have an attack hit a reinforced section.

After being used to soak damage this way, that gear becomes disabled and non-functional until it can be repaired back at a home base or facility with the proper tools and parts.

The referee will determine if using the gear fully negates the attack or just reduces the damage taken. More powerful or intense attacks may overwhelm a piece of gear’s protection capacity.

## Injuries

If a character sustains a serious injury during a game session, they will need to spend some in-game time in the medical bay to recover. The player should describe their character receiving medical treatment and the referee can narrate the passage of time during the healing process.

If a character is killed, the player should introduce a new character as soon as is practical. The referee should facilitate quickly integrating the new character into the ongoing story.

When adjudicating the effects of injuries or character death, inclusion of the affected player takes priority over adhering to strict realism. The referee should aim to avoid excluding a player from participation due to their character being incapacitated. Workarounds like having the player take temporary control of a supporting character can help keep everyone involved.

The risks of combat and other dangerous activities are an important part of the game’s drama and stakes. However, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have fun together. So when serious consequences occur, the referee should guide the narrative in a direction that returns the affected player to active participation in a seamless, collaborative manner.

## Game mastering

The referee portrays non-player characters (NPCs) by describing their behaviors, motivations, and obstacles they present to the player characters. The referee should lead the group in establishing boundaries for subject matter and conduct during play.

To control pacing and safety, the referee can fast-forward through uneventful stretches, pause play for breaks or sidebar discussions, or even rewind and redo a scene if needed. The referee should invite players to request scene edits too.

The referee should present dilemmas and challenges without pre-planned solutions, allowing the players to drive the direction of the story through their choices.

To give everyone screen time, the referee moves the spotlight around, checking in with each player in turn.

To inject randomness and chaos, the referee can occasionally test for bad luck by rolling a die - a 1-2 means trouble occurs, like running out of ammo at a bad time or stumbling into patrolling guards. A 3-4 indicates signs of impending trouble.

When the written rules don’t adequately cover a situation, the referee improvises rulings in the moment to keep the game moving. If any rulings seem unsatisfactory, the group should discuss them on a break and revise them collaboratively.

The referee portrays the world and inhabitants surrounding the player characters. By sharing narrative power while guiding pacing and monitoring safety, the referee enables the group to collectively build an exciting and satisfying story.

# Interstellar Travel

Interstellar travel in this universe is not only about reaching distant star systems but also about managing resources, calculating travel times through hyperspace corridors or wormholes, and facing unexpected encounters along the journey. The advanced propulsion systems and starships available offer a range of options, each with its own capabilities and limitations.

As you traverse the vastness of interstellar space, be prepared for the unexpected. Navigation hazards, random anomalies, and dangerous encounters may test your skills and decision-making. Whether negotiating with alien civilizations, repairing hyperdrives, or avoiding cosmic phenomena, your voyages will be filled with peril and wonder.

## Navigation Hazards

Navigating across interstellar distances presents unique challenges requiring precise calculations and skillful execution. Characters must navigate gravitational forces, celestial bodies, radiation hazards, and the complexities of hyperspace/wormhole travel to reach destinations safely.

During journeys, they may face:

1.  **Astrogation Challenges:** Plotting interstellar courses demands advanced astrogation accounting for factors like star locations, gravity wells, hyperspace corridors and jump points. Navigation checks determine trajectory accuracy and efficiency.

2.  **Gravity Slingshots:** Using a celestial body’s gravity can multiply a ship’s velocity. Characters must identify opportunities for gravity slingshots and execute complex maneuvers.

3.  **Hazardous Regions:** Certain areas teem with dangers like radiation clouds, asteroid fields or spatial anomalies. Characters must navigate around or shield against these threats.

4.  **Celestial Obstacles:** Ships may encounter rogue comets, debris fields or other stellar obstacles requiring evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions.

Characters skilled in astrogation, astrometrics and hyperspace physics will better overcome these challenges through calculation mastery and maneuver expertise.

### Random Interstellar Encounter Table

Roll 2d6 to determine a random encounter:

1.  **Spatial Anomaly:** The ship encounters strange phenomena like subspace eddies, gravitational lensing or radiation spikes requiring emergency navigation.

2.  **Distress Signal:** Characters receive a distress call they can investigate for trade, rescue or danger.

3.  **Debris Field:** The ship must navigate a field of ancient wreckage or technological debris, avoiding collisions.

4.  **Derelict Hulk:** Characters discover an abandoned alien craft, a chance for salvage or discovery of lost archeotech.

5.  **Astrogation Failure:** Systems experience a temporary astrogation failure, forcing manual navigation to get back on course.

6.  **Asteroid Hazard:** The ship traverses an asteroid belt requiring precision maneuvers to avoid destructive impacts.

7.  **Subspace Rift:** A rift or wormhole aperture appears, offering a shortcut or gateway to the unknown.

8.  **Pirate Ambush:** Hostile ships attempt to intercept, board or disable the characters’ vessel requiring evasion or combat.

9.  **Trade Opportunity:** Characters encounter a trader convoy offering a chance to barter for rare goods or intel.

10. **Celestial Phenomenon:** A rare stellar event like a pulsar flare or comet’s passing presents awe or research opportunities.

11. **Alien Artifact:** The ship’s sensors detect a drifting alien artifact of potentially immense value or power.

Interstellar voyages demand exceptional astrogation skills, quick reactions and courage to overcome navigation perils and strange encounters lurking in the cosmic void between stars.

## Travel Time and Fuel Consumption

Interstellar travel in this universe requires careful planning and resource management. Two main methods exist - conventional interplanetary travel within star systems, and utilization of the rare and precious jumpgate technology to traverse between neighboring systems.

### Interplanetary Travel

For voyages within a single star system, spacecraft must rely on conventional propulsion technology like fusion torches and Ion engines. These provide high levels of acceleration over long periods, but are still bound by the limits of relativistic physics.

Travel times between planets in a system can take weeks or months depending on the distances involved. A trip from Earth to the orbit of Neptune in our Solar system could take over 8 months with continuous acceleration and deceleration.

Fuel requirements scale with the mass of the spacecraft and desired acceleration rates. A large cargo hauler may require thousands of tons of fuel for an interplanetary journey, while efficient exploration craft can make do with far less.

Key considerations: - Conventional interplanetary drives are reliable but sluggish - High acceleration rates are possible but consume exponentially more fuel - In-system resource extraction and refueling is often necessary - Travel times must account for months of acceleration and deceleration

### Jumpgate Technology

The pivotal invention of jumpgate technology revolutionized interstellar travel by allowing effective faster-than-light transit between star systems up to 15 light-years apart. Jumpgates are artificially sustained wormholes stabilized by rare minerals and immense industrial megastructures.

While passage through a jumpgate is nearly instantaneous, the gates themselves are incredibly rare. The handful of known stable jumpgates discovered so far connect wealthy inner spheres of human-occupied space.

Operating a jumpgate requires astronomical quantities of exotic matter and antimatter fuel sources. This ensures they remain under strict control of system authorities and powerful corporations.

Key limitations: - Only a few dozen jumpgates exist across inhabited space - Maximum range is 15 light-years between connected gates  
\- Transits are effectively instantaneous but consume huge resources - Undiscovered systems lack gate access entirely

Given the scarcity of jumpgates, most interstellar travel still relies on protracted conventional voyages at sub-light speeds. Even with gate access, in-system travel requires months of careful planning. Jumpgates are highly strategic assets, but do not fully alleviate the challenges and perils of interstellar exploration and resource logistics in this universe.

## Environmental Hazards

Environmental Hazards play a significant role in *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, emphasizing the harsh realities and challenges of space colonization. Characters will encounter a range of hazards that pose risks to their well-being and mission success. These hazards include radiation exposure, microgravity environments, extreme temperatures, and the scarcity of resources. Mechanisms are in place to address these challenges and ensure the characters’ survival and progress in the game.

### Radiation Exposure

Space is filled with various forms of radiation that can be harmful to humans and equipment. Characters must navigate through regions with higher radiation levels cautiously, utilize radiation shielding materials and equipment to minimize exposure, and monitor radiation levels to avoid long-term health effects. The Referee may introduce radiation events or zones that require characters to make decisions regarding their routes, resource allocation for shielding, or even engaging in special missions to repair or secure radiation shielding on structures or spacecraft.

### Microgravity Environments

In microgravity conditions, characters experience weightlessness, which can affect their physical capabilities and equipment. Characters must adapt to the challenges of moving, performing tasks, and manipulating objects in a microgravity environment. They may require specialized training or equipment, such as magnetic boots or handheld propulsion devices, to maintain stability and maneuver effectively. The Referee can introduce skill checks or mechanics to simulate the unique physics of microgravity, adding an additional layer of complexity to character actions and decision-making.

### Extreme Temperatures

The vastness of space brings extreme temperature variations, from freezing cold to scorching heat. Characters must prepare for these extreme temperatures by wearing appropriate environmental suits, utilizing temperature regulation systems, and ensuring proper insulation in their habitats and vehicles. Failure to manage temperature extremes can lead to equipment malfunctions, damage to life support systems, or even life-threatening conditions for characters. The Referee can introduce mechanics for monitoring temperature levels, making temperature-related skill checks, or incorporating events where characters must deal with unexpected temperature fluctuations.

### Scarcity of Resources

Resources in space are limited, and characters must face the challenges of managing and rationing essential supplies such as oxygen, water, food, and energy. The scarcity of resources adds an additional layer of tension and decision-making to the game. Characters may need to engage in resource acquisition missions, establish mining operations, or trade with other factions to secure the necessary supplies for survival and mission objectives. The Referee can implement resource management mechanics, encounters related to resource scarcity, or events that test characters’ ability to make tough choices regarding resource allocation.

### Environmental Suits and Scientific Equipment

Environmental suits provide protection against the harsh space environments, including temperature extremes, radiation, and micrometeoroids. Characters must have access to and maintain environmental suits to venture outside habitats or spacecraft. Additionally, scientific equipment such as spectrometers, telescopes, or microscopes allow characters to gather valuable data, conduct experiments, and make discoveries. These tools are essential for scientific research and can provide insights into the environment, resources, and potential threats.

# The Age of Expansion

By the late 21st century, humanity had outgrown its cradle. The solar system became our new frontier, its planets and moons transformed into battlegrounds of politics, innovation, and survival. What began as a struggle for autonomy among colonies evolved into the foundation of the Sol Union, a fragile unity in the face of the unknown.

The early experiments with wormholes cracked the door to interstellar exploration, but it was decades before the courage and technology existed to walk through it. As humanity reached new stars, it carried with it old tensions: the balance between control and freedom, preservation and exploitation. The colonies of the “frontier” grew restless, and the systems closer to Sol wrestled with their own evolving identity.

When alien ruins were discovered in 2295, they shattered the illusion that humanity was alone. Though their builders were long gone, the ruins whispered of civilizations far older and more advanced. This revelation lit a fire beneath humanity’s ambitions, pushing us further into the void—not just to settle, but to understand.

From a fragile beginning to an expanding web of stargates and alliances, this era defined what it meant to be human in a universe where the stars were no longer out of reach.

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is the direct sequel to *Sol: Beyond Earth*

CC BY-SA 4.0 \# Frontier: Beyond Sol

Under the ghostly glow of SZ Ursae Majoris’ seventh planet, a cold martian giant, the small, stealthy vessel *Nimbus* held its position, nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding space debris. Inside, a team of Sol Union operatives prepared for a mission that tread the line between diplomacy and covert action in the uncharted reaches of space.

“Visuals up. We’re going in silent, but ready for anything,” Captain Elena Reyes instructed, her voice calm but carrying an undercurrent of anticipation. The *Nimbus* was a shadow against the planet’s icy rings, ready to deploy its team to a hidden base suspected of harboring technology that could shift the power dynamics within the Union.

Zan, her second-in-command, scanned the data streaming on his screen. “Approach vector locked. We’re ghosting through their scanners.”

In the dim light of the command deck, Ila, their communications and tech expert, piped up, “Jamming signals ready. We’ll be in and out before they know it.”

Elena nodded, turning to the rest of her crew. “This isn’t just about the tech. It’s about sending a message. We do this right, we could be paving the way for a new era of cooperation — or confrontation.”

Tarek, the team’s engineer, adjusted his gear, a mix of excitement and focus on his face. “Let’s make sure it’s cooperation then. I didn’t tweak these suits for nothing.”

A soft chuckle ran through the crew, easing the tension. Lian, who had been studying the planet’s atmospheric readings, added, “Remember, we’re not just operatives. We’re ambassadors. Every action reflects on the Sol Union.”

As the *Nimbus* neared the drop point, Elena shared a final glance with her team. “We all know the stakes. Let’s show them what the Sol Union stands for.”

The operatives moved towards the airlock, their suits equipped with the latest in stealth and environmental technology. As the outer door opened, revealing the vast, silent expanse of space, Zan muttered under his breath, a hint of humor in his voice, “Ambassadors with style, at least.”

One by one, they stepped into the void, their figures swallowed by the darkness as they made their silent approach to the hidden base, a speck of light against the infinite canvas of space.

# What is Frontier: Beyond Sol

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is a roleplaying game in which you will define an imagined space bounded by rules. Actions and events occur through procedure-driven player interaction. This facilitates an emergent shared narrative.

Put plainly, players will assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. The characters will act according to the rules of the game that will guarantee their success or failure. The outcome of actions will have an effect on the narrative that emerges.

A game of *Frontier: Beyond Sol* takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the other players.

  - The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing Characters.
  - The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out their Character or play them impersonally. Players should also ask questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:

  - At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal number of players is 4-5 players, maximum 6.
  - A complete set of polyhedral dice, preferably one for each player.
  - Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the following principles in mind:

  - **Fiction over mechanics.** This ruleset is intentionally streamlined and prioritizes fiction over complex mechanics. If you are primarily interested in a game with detailed mechanical systems, there are other rulesets that may be better suited to your preferences.
  - **The Referee is a player.** Although the Referee has different responsibilities than the other players, they should still be considered as a fellow player and should not shoulder more responsibility for the success of the game than anyone else at the table.
  - **Referee’s Mediating Role.** The Referee does not compete against other players; their role is solely to arbitrate situations within the context of the game. They are responsible for maintaining consistency, ensuring fairness, and resolving any disputes or conflicts that may arise during play.
  - **Promote Cooperative Play.** This game is intended to be played collaboratively, with a focus on teamwork and overcoming challenges as a group. As such, competition between players should be discouraged in favor of cooperation and mutual support. The characters should work together to confront the obstacles and threats posed by the game world, rather than engaging in individualistic or adversarial behavior.
  - **Information Query.** Players should ask the Referee questions in a concise and straightforward manner. The Referee, in turn, should provide clear and detailed explanations of the context and the potential risks associated with each action taken by the characters. This helps to ensure that players make informed decisions and understand the consequences of their actions.
  - **Action first.** When describing an action, players should first provide a clear and detailed description of what their character is attempting to do. Only after the action has been fully described should the Referee request a dice roll, if necessary, to determine the outcome of the action. This helps to ensure that the narrative flows smoothly and that players have a clear understanding of the sequence of events.
  - **Emergent Fiction.** The game thrives on emergent fiction, where the narrative evolves naturally from player choices and interactions. Be prepared for unexpected twists and developments, and allow the story to unfold organically based on the characters’ actions and decisions. Embrace the creativity and spontaneity that arise from collaborative storytelling, and don’t be afraid to deviate from preconceived notions of how the plot should progress.
  - **Embrace uncertainty.** Embracing uncertainty is at the core of this game. Embrace the unpredictability of player choices and the twists and turns the narrative may take. Avoid rigidly planning every detail and be open to adapting to the unexpected. This willingness to embrace uncertainty can lead to some of the most memorable and engaging moments in the game, so relish the uncertainty and let it guide the storytelling.

## A word about “realism”

In playing *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, it is important to embrace a sense of realism that remains consistent with the game’s setting, backgrounds, equipment, and accompanying illustrations. This hard sci-fi universe is designed to inspire players and immerse them in a believable and captivating experience. While it is not mandatory to have prior knowledge of the specific science fiction genre or to read the sources of inspiration, doing so can deepen the appreciation for the game’s intricacies. While true “realism” is impossible in a fictional game, it is crucial to avoid indulging in absurdities and instead strive for consistency with the established setting and adhere to general principles of physics. By embracing this approach, players can engage in an authentic and immersive gaming experience that respects the established rules and allows for a compelling and plausible narrative to unfold.

## Safety Tools

It is important to remember that not everyone at the table may be comfortable with the themes or content addressed by the game, or with the actions of the other players. It is therefore important to establish clear boundaries and expectations at the beginning of the game, and to be sensitive to the needs and feelings of all participants throughout the session. It may also be helpful to establish a system for communicating discomfort or taking breaks if needed.

There are various safety tools and techniques that can help create a comfortable and safe environment for everyone involved in the game, such as [Lines And Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean), [C.A.T.S.](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/), the [X-Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit?usp=sharing), and [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/).

It is important to familiarize yourself with these tools and techniques and to use them proactively to ensure that everyone feels safe and comfortable during the game.

# How to play

The role of the Referee is to control the game universe: he describes situations, NPCs, and their reactions to the PCs’ actions. He or she should be as clear as possible about the conditions of the context in which the characters are immersed: if there is a reasonable certainty that the character has access to a piece of information or knowledge, the referee should communicate it to the player, without asking for a roll. In this game, a roll is made only for situations of risk or uncertainty of the outcome of a direct action.

  - If an action is impossible, the referee simply declares it so by explaining why and describing the possible alternatives to the player.
  - If the cost of an action is explicit, the referee will clearly present it. The player can decide whether to take the action or try another one.
  - If the action involves a risk, the referee will communicate this clearly. The player will be able to make informed decisions about the action they want to take and they will pull to determine the outcome.

In all other cases, the action is automatically successful.

## Rolling

When a character attempts an action with significant risk, the player rolls a skill die to determine the outcome. The default is a d6.

  - If the character has applicable skills or talents, they roll a bigger die like d8 or d10 to represent competence.
  - Conversely, if *hindered* by injuries or obstacles may warrant a smaller die like d4 to show impairment.

The player can also roll bonus dice based on circumstances:

  - Favorable conditions grant an extra d6 die. Things like having the high ground in combat or proper tools for a repair task.
  - An ally who helps adds their own skill die to the roll, representing combined effort. The ally shares in any risk.

The player rolls their skill die plus any bonus dice, taking the single highest result.

  - **1-2, disaster.** The full brunt of the risk occurs, and the Referee judges if there is any success at all. A roll this bad could mean instant death when mortality is on the line.
  - **3-4, setback.** You suffer a lesser or partial consequence. If risking death, the character might survive but with a grievous injury and *hindered*.
  - **5+, success.** The higher numbers, the better the outcomes.

The core mechanic balances risk versus reward, with competence and teamwork aiding success. But dire consequences are still possible, maintaining high drama and tension.

## Load

Characters can carry as many possessions as reasonably fits their physical capacity and the storage space on their person. For example, a character could carry a weapon, some tools, and a backpack containing rations and other useful adventuring gear.

However, if a character loads themselves down with multiple overly bulky or heavy items, it may hinder their ability to move and act freely at times. For instance, carrying a large shield, a two-handed weapon, and a bulging sack of gear may make it difficult to squeeze through narrow spaces or balance while climbing.

In such cases, the referee will inform the player that their character’s encumbrance is \_hindering \_their movement or dexterity in the current situation. The player can then decide to temporarily set down some of their carried items to proceed unfettered, stowing the extra gear nearby to be retrieved later. Or they may opt to continue carrying everything, accepting additional challenges or risks to their intended actions.

## Advancement

After successfully completing a mission or major story milestone, each player character will improve in the following ways as a reward for their accomplishments:

  - Increase one of their skill ranks by one step on the progression track (none → d8 → d10 → d12). This represents honing their competencies through experience.
  - Gain a number of currency credits (₡) equal to a d6 roll. Credits can be spent to acquire new gear, weapons, cyberware, services, etc. The die roll result encourages uncertainty in the exact amount of new wealth obtained.

For example, after infiltrating an enemy base undetected and stealing valuable data, a character with stealth and hacking skills currently at d8 could increase their stealth to d10 for greater sneaking ability. They also would gain somewhere between 1-6 credits to spend on desired upgrades and purchases.

This dual progression system rewards both new capabilities and resources, allowing characters to become more powerful and versatile over the course of the campaign. The incremental upgrades create a satisfying sense of growth and advancement for each successful mission. But the unpredictability keeps material gain uncertain, maintaining long-term goals and motivation.

## Damage Control

Say how you use a piece of gear to absorb damage. It’s disabled until repaired at a base.

When a character is about to take damage from an attack or hazard, the player can describe how they utilize a piece of equipment to absorb some or all of the incoming damage. This could involve actions like raising a shield to block an incoming blow, using a large tool as cover from an explosion, or angling a vehicle to have an attack hit a reinforced section.

After being used to soak damage this way, that gear becomes disabled and non-functional until it can be repaired back at a home base or facility with the proper tools and parts.

The referee will determine if using the gear fully negates the attack or just reduces the damage taken. More powerful or intense attacks may overwhelm a piece of gear’s protection capacity.

## Injuries

If a character sustains a serious injury during a game session, they will need to spend some in-game time in the medical bay to recover. The player should describe their character receiving medical treatment and the referee can narrate the passage of time during the healing process.

If a character is killed, the player should introduce a new character as soon as is practical. The referee should facilitate quickly integrating the new character into the ongoing story.

When adjudicating the effects of injuries or character death, inclusion of the affected player takes priority over adhering to strict realism. The referee should aim to avoid excluding a player from participation due to their character being incapacitated. Workarounds like having the player take temporary control of a supporting character can help keep everyone involved.

The risks of combat and other dangerous activities are an important part of the game’s drama and stakes. However, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have fun together. So when serious consequences occur, the referee should guide the narrative in a direction that returns the affected player to active participation in a seamless, collaborative manner.

## Game mastering

The referee portrays non-player characters (NPCs) by describing their behaviors, motivations, and obstacles they present to the player characters. The referee should lead the group in establishing boundaries for subject matter and conduct during play.

To control pacing and safety, the referee can fast-forward through uneventful stretches, pause play for breaks or sidebar discussions, or even rewind and redo a scene if needed. The referee should invite players to request scene edits too.

The referee should present dilemmas and challenges without pre-planned solutions, allowing the players to drive the direction of the story through their choices.

To give everyone screen time, the referee moves the spotlight around, checking in with each player in turn.

To inject randomness and chaos, the referee can occasionally test for bad luck by rolling a die - a 1-2 means trouble occurs, like running out of ammo at a bad time or stumbling into patrolling guards. A 3-4 indicates signs of impending trouble.

When the written rules don’t adequately cover a situation, the referee improvises rulings in the moment to keep the game moving. If any rulings seem unsatisfactory, the group should discuss them on a break and revise them collaboratively.

The referee portrays the world and inhabitants surrounding the player characters. By sharing narrative power while guiding pacing and monitoring safety, the referee enables the group to collectively build an exciting and satisfying story.

# Interstellar Travel

Interstellar travel in this universe is not only about reaching distant star systems but also about managing resources, calculating travel times through hyperspace corridors or wormholes, and facing unexpected encounters along the journey. The advanced propulsion systems and starships available offer a range of options, each with its own capabilities and limitations.

As you traverse the vastness of interstellar space, be prepared for the unexpected. Navigation hazards, random anomalies, and dangerous encounters may test your skills and decision-making. Whether negotiating with alien civilizations, repairing hyperdrives, or avoiding cosmic phenomena, your voyages will be filled with peril and wonder.

## Navigation Hazards

Navigating across interstellar distances presents unique challenges requiring precise calculations and skillful execution. Characters must navigate gravitational forces, celestial bodies, radiation hazards, and the complexities of hyperspace/wormhole travel to reach destinations safely.

During journeys, they may face:

1.  **Astrogation Challenges:** Plotting interstellar courses demands advanced astrogation accounting for factors like star locations, gravity wells, hyperspace corridors and jump points. Navigation checks determine trajectory accuracy and efficiency.

2.  **Gravity Slingshots:** Using a celestial body’s gravity can multiply a ship’s velocity. Characters must identify opportunities for gravity slingshots and execute complex maneuvers.

3.  **Hazardous Regions:** Certain areas teem with dangers like radiation clouds, asteroid fields or spatial anomalies. Characters must navigate around or shield against these threats.

4.  **Celestial Obstacles:** Ships may encounter rogue comets, debris fields or other stellar obstacles requiring evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions.

Characters skilled in astrogation, astrometrics and hyperspace physics will better overcome these challenges through calculation mastery and maneuver expertise.

### Random Interstellar Encounter Table

Roll 2d6 to determine a random encounter:

1.  **Spatial Anomaly:** The ship encounters strange phenomena like subspace eddies, gravitational lensing or radiation spikes requiring emergency navigation.

2.  **Distress Signal:** Characters receive a distress call they can investigate for trade, rescue or danger.

3.  **Debris Field:** The ship must navigate a field of ancient wreckage or technological debris, avoiding collisions.

4.  **Derelict Hulk:** Characters discover an abandoned alien craft, a chance for salvage or discovery of lost archeotech.

5.  **Astrogation Failure:** Systems experience a temporary astrogation failure, forcing manual navigation to get back on course.

6.  **Asteroid Hazard:** The ship traverses an asteroid belt requiring precision maneuvers to avoid destructive impacts.

7.  **Subspace Rift:** A rift or wormhole aperture appears, offering a shortcut or gateway to the unknown.

8.  **Pirate Ambush:** Hostile ships attempt to intercept, board or disable the characters’ vessel requiring evasion or combat.

9.  **Trade Opportunity:** Characters encounter a trader convoy offering a chance to barter for rare goods or intel.

10. **Celestial Phenomenon:** A rare stellar event like a pulsar flare or comet’s passing presents awe or research opportunities.

11. **Alien Artifact:** The ship’s sensors detect a drifting alien artifact of potentially immense value or power.

Interstellar voyages demand exceptional astrogation skills, quick reactions and courage to overcome navigation perils and strange encounters lurking in the cosmic void between stars.

## Travel Time and Fuel Consumption

Interstellar travel in this universe requires careful planning and resource management. Two main methods exist - conventional interplanetary travel within star systems, and utilization of the rare and precious jumpgate technology to traverse between neighboring systems.

### Interplanetary Travel

For voyages within a single star system, spacecraft must rely on conventional propulsion technology like fusion torches and Ion engines. These provide high levels of acceleration over long periods, but are still bound by the limits of relativistic physics.

Travel times between planets in a system can take weeks or months depending on the distances involved. A trip from Earth to the orbit of Neptune in our Solar system could take over 8 months with continuous acceleration and deceleration.

Fuel requirements scale with the mass of the spacecraft and desired acceleration rates. A large cargo hauler may require thousands of tons of fuel for an interplanetary journey, while efficient exploration craft can make do with far less.

Key considerations: - Conventional interplanetary drives are reliable but sluggish - High acceleration rates are possible but consume exponentially more fuel - In-system resource extraction and refueling is often necessary - Travel times must account for months of acceleration and deceleration

### Jumpgate Technology

The pivotal invention of jumpgate technology revolutionized interstellar travel by allowing effective faster-than-light transit between star systems up to 15 light-years apart. Jumpgates are artificially sustained wormholes stabilized by rare minerals and immense industrial megastructures.

While passage through a jumpgate is nearly instantaneous, the gates themselves are incredibly rare. The handful of known stable jumpgates discovered so far connect wealthy inner spheres of human-occupied space.

Operating a jumpgate requires astronomical quantities of exotic matter and antimatter fuel sources. This ensures they remain under strict control of system authorities and powerful corporations.

Key limitations: - Only a few dozen jumpgates exist across inhabited space - Maximum range is 15 light-years between connected gates  
\- Transits are effectively instantaneous but consume huge resources - Undiscovered systems lack gate access entirely

Given the scarcity of jumpgates, most interstellar travel still relies on protracted conventional voyages at sub-light speeds. Even with gate access, in-system travel requires months of careful planning. Jumpgates are highly strategic assets, but do not fully alleviate the challenges and perils of interstellar exploration and resource logistics in this universe.

## Environmental Hazards

Environmental Hazards play a significant role in *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, emphasizing the harsh realities and challenges of space colonization. Characters will encounter a range of hazards that pose risks to their well-being and mission success. These hazards include radiation exposure, microgravity environments, extreme temperatures, and the scarcity of resources. Mechanisms are in place to address these challenges and ensure the characters’ survival and progress in the game.

### Radiation Exposure

Space is filled with various forms of radiation that can be harmful to humans and equipment. Characters must navigate through regions with higher radiation levels cautiously, utilize radiation shielding materials and equipment to minimize exposure, and monitor radiation levels to avoid long-term health effects. The Referee may introduce radiation events or zones that require characters to make decisions regarding their routes, resource allocation for shielding, or even engaging in special missions to repair or secure radiation shielding on structures or spacecraft.

### Microgravity Environments

In microgravity conditions, characters experience weightlessness, which can affect their physical capabilities and equipment. Characters must adapt to the challenges of moving, performing tasks, and manipulating objects in a microgravity environment. They may require specialized training or equipment, such as magnetic boots or handheld propulsion devices, to maintain stability and maneuver effectively. The Referee can introduce skill checks or mechanics to simulate the unique physics of microgravity, adding an additional layer of complexity to character actions and decision-making.

### Extreme Temperatures

The vastness of space brings extreme temperature variations, from freezing cold to scorching heat. Characters must prepare for these extreme temperatures by wearing appropriate environmental suits, utilizing temperature regulation systems, and ensuring proper insulation in their habitats and vehicles. Failure to manage temperature extremes can lead to equipment malfunctions, damage to life support systems, or even life-threatening conditions for characters. The Referee can introduce mechanics for monitoring temperature levels, making temperature-related skill checks, or incorporating events where characters must deal with unexpected temperature fluctuations.

### Scarcity of Resources

Resources in space are limited, and characters must face the challenges of managing and rationing essential supplies such as oxygen, water, food, and energy. The scarcity of resources adds an additional layer of tension and decision-making to the game. Characters may need to engage in resource acquisition missions, establish mining operations, or trade with other factions to secure the necessary supplies for survival and mission objectives. The Referee can implement resource management mechanics, encounters related to resource scarcity, or events that test characters’ ability to make tough choices regarding resource allocation.

### Environmental Suits and Scientific Equipment

Environmental suits provide protection against the harsh space environments, including temperature extremes, radiation, and micrometeoroids. Characters must have access to and maintain environmental suits to venture outside habitats or spacecraft. Additionally, scientific equipment such as spectrometers, telescopes, or microscopes allow characters to gather valuable data, conduct experiments, and make discoveries. These tools are essential for scientific research and can provide insights into the environment, resources, and potential threats.

## Vehicles

  - **Interstellar Shuttle:** The Interstellar Shuttle is a versatile small spacecraft designed for transportation between planets, moons, and space stations within a single star system. It features advanced propulsion and life support systems, allowing for efficient travel and comfortable accommodation for passengers and light cargo. The Shuttle serves as a vital link in the transportation infrastructure of colonies, facilitating the movement of personnel, supplies, and resources.

  - **Planetary Rover:** The Planetary Rover is a rugged and adaptable vehicle designed for surface exploration on various celestial bodies. It boasts a modular construction, allowing for customization with different propulsion systems, environmental protection, and scientific equipment to suit the conditions of the planet or moon being explored. The Rover provides a mobile base for research teams, enabling them to conduct detailed surveys, collect samples, and investigate diverse extraterrestrial environments.

  - **Cryogenic Terrain Vehicle:** The Cryogenic Terrain Vehicle is a specialized craft engineered for operations on icy, cryogenic worlds or moons with frozen surfaces.

# The Age of Expansion

By the late 21st century, humanity had outgrown its cradle. The solar system became our new frontier, its planets and moons transformed into battlegrounds of politics, innovation, and survival. What began as a struggle for autonomy among colonies evolved into the foundation of the Sol Union, a fragile unity in the face of the unknown.

The early experiments with wormholes cracked the door to interstellar exploration, but it was decades before the courage and technology existed to walk through it. As humanity reached new stars, it carried with it old tensions: the balance between control and freedom, preservation and exploitation. The colonies of the “frontier” grew restless, and the systems closer to Sol wrestled with their own evolving identity.

When alien ruins were discovered in 2295, they shattered the illusion that humanity was alone. Though their builders were long gone, the ruins whispered of civilizations far older and more advanced. This revelation lit a fire beneath humanity’s ambitions, pushing us further into the void—not just to settle, but to understand.

From a fragile beginning to an expanding web of stargates and alliances, this era defined what it meant to be human in a universe where the stars were no longer out of reach.

## Chronology

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is the direct sequel to *Sol: Beyond Earth*

CC BY-SA 4.0 \# Frontier: Beyond Sol

Under the ghostly glow of SZ Ursae Majoris’ seventh planet, a cold martian giant, the small, stealthy vessel *Nimbus* held its position, nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding space debris. Inside, a team of Sol Union operatives prepared for a mission that tread the line between diplomacy and covert action in the uncharted reaches of space.

“Visuals up. We’re going in silent, but ready for anything,” Captain Elena Reyes instructed, her voice calm but carrying an undercurrent of anticipation. The *Nimbus* was a shadow against the planet’s icy rings, ready to deploy its team to a hidden base suspected of harboring technology that could shift the power dynamics within the Union.

Zan, her second-in-command, scanned the data streaming on his screen. “Approach vector locked. We’re ghosting through their scanners.”

In the dim light of the command deck, Ila, their communications and tech expert, piped up, “Jamming signals ready. We’ll be in and out before they know it.”

Elena nodded, turning to the rest of her crew. “This isn’t just about the tech. It’s about sending a message. We do this right, we could be paving the way for a new era of cooperation — or confrontation.”

Tarek, the team’s engineer, adjusted his gear, a mix of excitement and focus on his face. “Let’s make sure it’s cooperation then. I didn’t tweak these suits for nothing.”

A soft chuckle ran through the crew, easing the tension. Lian, who had been studying the planet’s atmospheric readings, added, “Remember, we’re not just operatives. We’re ambassadors. Every action reflects on the Sol Union.”

As the *Nimbus* neared the drop point, Elena shared a final glance with her team. “We all know the stakes. Let’s show them what the Sol Union stands for.”

The operatives moved towards the airlock, their suits equipped with the latest in stealth and environmental technology. As the outer door opened, revealing the vast, silent expanse of space, Zan muttered under his breath, a hint of humor in his voice, “Ambassadors with style, at least.”

One by one, they stepped into the void, their figures swallowed by the darkness as they made their silent approach to the hidden base, a speck of light against the infinite canvas of space.

# What is Frontier: Beyond Sol

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is a roleplaying game in which you will define an imagined space bounded by rules. Actions and events occur through procedure-driven player interaction. This facilitates an emergent shared narrative.

Put plainly, players will assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. The characters will act according to the rules of the game that will guarantee their success or failure. The outcome of actions will have an effect on the narrative that emerges.

A game of *Frontier: Beyond Sol* takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the other players.

  - The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing Characters.
  - The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out their Character or play them impersonally. Players should also ask questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:

  - At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal number of players is 4-5 players, maximum 6.
  - A complete set of polyhedral dice, preferably one for each player.
  - Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the following principles in mind:

  - **Fiction over mechanics.** This ruleset is intentionally streamlined and prioritizes fiction over complex mechanics. If you are primarily interested in a game with detailed mechanical systems, there are other rulesets that may be better suited to your preferences.
  - **The Referee is a player.** Although the Referee has different responsibilities than the other players, they should still be considered as a fellow player and should not shoulder more responsibility for the success of the game than anyone else at the table.
  - **Referee’s Mediating Role.** The Referee does not compete against other players; their role is solely to arbitrate situations within the context of the game. They are responsible for maintaining consistency, ensuring fairness, and resolving any disputes or conflicts that may arise during play.
  - **Promote Cooperative Play.** This game is intended to be played collaboratively, with a focus on teamwork and overcoming challenges as a group. As such, competition between players should be discouraged in favor of cooperation and mutual support. The characters should work together to confront the obstacles and threats posed by the game world, rather than engaging in individualistic or adversarial behavior.
  - **Information Query.** Players should ask the Referee questions in a concise and straightforward manner. The Referee, in turn, should provide clear and detailed explanations of the context and the potential risks associated with each action taken by the characters. This helps to ensure that players make informed decisions and understand the consequences of their actions.
  - **Action first.** When describing an action, players should first provide a clear and detailed description of what their character is attempting to do. Only after the action has been fully described should the Referee request a dice roll, if necessary, to determine the outcome of the action. This helps to ensure that the narrative flows smoothly and that players have a clear understanding of the sequence of events.
  - **Emergent Fiction.** The game thrives on emergent fiction, where the narrative evolves naturally from player choices and interactions. Be prepared for unexpected twists and developments, and allow the story to unfold organically based on the characters’ actions and decisions. Embrace the creativity and spontaneity that arise from collaborative storytelling, and don’t be afraid to deviate from preconceived notions of how the plot should progress.
  - **Embrace uncertainty.** Embracing uncertainty is at the core of this game. Embrace the unpredictability of player choices and the twists and turns the narrative may take. Avoid rigidly planning every detail and be open to adapting to the unexpected. This willingness to embrace uncertainty can lead to some of the most memorable and engaging moments in the game, so relish the uncertainty and let it guide the storytelling.

## A word about “realism”

In playing *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, it is important to embrace a sense of realism that remains consistent with the game’s setting, backgrounds, equipment, and accompanying illustrations. This hard sci-fi universe is designed to inspire players and immerse them in a believable and captivating experience. While it is not mandatory to have prior knowledge of the specific science fiction genre or to read the sources of inspiration, doing so can deepen the appreciation for the game’s intricacies. While true “realism” is impossible in a fictional game, it is crucial to avoid indulging in absurdities and instead strive for consistency with the established setting and adhere to general principles of physics. By embracing this approach, players can engage in an authentic and immersive gaming experience that respects the established rules and allows for a compelling and plausible narrative to unfold.

## Safety Tools

It is important to remember that not everyone at the table may be comfortable with the themes or content addressed by the game, or with the actions of the other players. It is therefore important to establish clear boundaries and expectations at the beginning of the game, and to be sensitive to the needs and feelings of all participants throughout the session. It may also be helpful to establish a system for communicating discomfort or taking breaks if needed.

There are various safety tools and techniques that can help create a comfortable and safe environment for everyone involved in the game, such as [Lines And Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean), [C.A.T.S.](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/), the [X-Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit?usp=sharing), and [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/).

It is important to familiarize yourself with these tools and techniques and to use them proactively to ensure that everyone feels safe and comfortable during the game.

# How to play

The role of the Referee is to control the game universe: he describes situations, NPCs, and their reactions to the PCs’ actions. He or she should be as clear as possible about the conditions of the context in which the characters are immersed: if there is a reasonable certainty that the character has access to a piece of information or knowledge, the referee should communicate it to the player, without asking for a roll. In this game, a roll is made only for situations of risk or uncertainty of the outcome of a direct action.

  - If an action is impossible, the referee simply declares it so by explaining why and describing the possible alternatives to the player.
  - If the cost of an action is explicit, the referee will clearly present it. The player can decide whether to take the action or try another one.
  - If the action involves a risk, the referee will communicate this clearly. The player will be able to make informed decisions about the action they want to take and they will pull to determine the outcome.

In all other cases, the action is automatically successful.

## Rolling

When a character attempts an action with significant risk, the player rolls a skill die to determine the outcome. The default is a d6.

  - If the character has applicable skills or talents, they roll a bigger die like d8 or d10 to represent competence.
  - Conversely, if *hindered* by injuries or obstacles may warrant a smaller die like d4 to show impairment.

The player can also roll bonus dice based on circumstances:

  - Favorable conditions grant an extra d6 die. Things like having the high ground in combat or proper tools for a repair task.
  - An ally who helps adds their own skill die to the roll, representing combined effort. The ally shares in any risk.

The player rolls their skill die plus any bonus dice, taking the single highest result.

  - **1-2, disaster.** The full brunt of the risk occurs, and the Referee judges if there is any success at all. A roll this bad could mean instant death when mortality is on the line.
  - **3-4, setback.** You suffer a lesser or partial consequence. If risking death, the character might survive but with a grievous injury and *hindered*.
  - **5+, success.** The higher numbers, the better the outcomes.

The core mechanic balances risk versus reward, with competence and teamwork aiding success. But dire consequences are still possible, maintaining high drama and tension.

## Load

Characters can carry as many possessions as reasonably fits their physical capacity and the storage space on their person. For example, a character could carry a weapon, some tools, and a backpack containing rations and other useful adventuring gear.

However, if a character loads themselves down with multiple overly bulky or heavy items, it may hinder their ability to move and act freely at times. For instance, carrying a large shield, a two-handed weapon, and a bulging sack of gear may make it difficult to squeeze through narrow spaces or balance while climbing.

In such cases, the referee will inform the player that their character’s encumbrance is \_hindering \_their movement or dexterity in the current situation. The player can then decide to temporarily set down some of their carried items to proceed unfettered, stowing the extra gear nearby to be retrieved later. Or they may opt to continue carrying everything, accepting additional challenges or risks to their intended actions.

## Advancement

After successfully completing a mission or major story milestone, each player character will improve in the following ways as a reward for their accomplishments:

  - Increase one of their skill ranks by one step on the progression track (none → d8 → d10 → d12). This represents honing their competencies through experience.
  - Gain a number of currency credits (₡) equal to a d6 roll. Credits can be spent to acquire new gear, weapons, cyberware, services, etc. The die roll result encourages uncertainty in the exact amount of new wealth obtained.

For example, after infiltrating an enemy base undetected and stealing valuable data, a character with stealth and hacking skills currently at d8 could increase their stealth to d10 for greater sneaking ability. They also would gain somewhere between 1-6 credits to spend on desired upgrades and purchases.

This dual progression system rewards both new capabilities and resources, allowing characters to become more powerful and versatile over the course of the campaign. The incremental upgrades create a satisfying sense of growth and advancement for each successful mission. But the unpredictability keeps material gain uncertain, maintaining long-term goals and motivation.

## Damage Control

Say how you use a piece of gear to absorb damage. It’s disabled until repaired at a base.

When a character is about to take damage from an attack or hazard, the player can describe how they utilize a piece of equipment to absorb some or all of the incoming damage. This could involve actions like raising a shield to block an incoming blow, using a large tool as cover from an explosion, or angling a vehicle to have an attack hit a reinforced section.

After being used to soak damage this way, that gear becomes disabled and non-functional until it can be repaired back at a home base or facility with the proper tools and parts.

The referee will determine if using the gear fully negates the attack or just reduces the damage taken. More powerful or intense attacks may overwhelm a piece of gear’s protection capacity.

## Injuries

If a character sustains a serious injury during a game session, they will need to spend some in-game time in the medical bay to recover. The player should describe their character receiving medical treatment and the referee can narrate the passage of time during the healing process.

If a character is killed, the player should introduce a new character as soon as is practical. The referee should facilitate quickly integrating the new character into the ongoing story.

When adjudicating the effects of injuries or character death, inclusion of the affected player takes priority over adhering to strict realism. The referee should aim to avoid excluding a player from participation due to their character being incapacitated. Workarounds like having the player take temporary control of a supporting character can help keep everyone involved.

The risks of combat and other dangerous activities are an important part of the game’s drama and stakes. However, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have fun together. So when serious consequences occur, the referee should guide the narrative in a direction that returns the affected player to active participation in a seamless, collaborative manner.

## Game mastering

The referee portrays non-player characters (NPCs) by describing their behaviors, motivations, and obstacles they present to the player characters. The referee should lead the group in establishing boundaries for subject matter and conduct during play.

To control pacing and safety, the referee can fast-forward through uneventful stretches, pause play for breaks or sidebar discussions, or even rewind and redo a scene if needed. The referee should invite players to request scene edits too.

The referee should present dilemmas and challenges without pre-planned solutions, allowing the players to drive the direction of the story through their choices.

To give everyone screen time, the referee moves the spotlight around, checking in with each player in turn.

To inject randomness and chaos, the referee can occasionally test for bad luck by rolling a die - a 1-2 means trouble occurs, like running out of ammo at a bad time or stumbling into patrolling guards. A 3-4 indicates signs of impending trouble.

When the written rules don’t adequately cover a situation, the referee improvises rulings in the moment to keep the game moving. If any rulings seem unsatisfactory, the group should discuss them on a break and revise them collaboratively.

The referee portrays the world and inhabitants surrounding the player characters. By sharing narrative power while guiding pacing and monitoring safety, the referee enables the group to collectively build an exciting and satisfying story.

# Interstellar Travel

Interstellar travel in this universe is not only about reaching distant star systems but also about managing resources, calculating travel times through hyperspace corridors or wormholes, and facing unexpected encounters along the journey. The advanced propulsion systems and starships available offer a range of options, each with its own capabilities and limitations.

As you traverse the vastness of interstellar space, be prepared for the unexpected. Navigation hazards, random anomalies, and dangerous encounters may test your skills and decision-making. Whether negotiating with alien civilizations, repairing hyperdrives, or avoiding cosmic phenomena, your voyages will be filled with peril and wonder.

## Navigation Hazards

Navigating across interstellar distances presents unique challenges requiring precise calculations and skillful execution. Characters must navigate gravitational forces, celestial bodies, radiation hazards, and the complexities of hyperspace/wormhole travel to reach destinations safely.

During journeys, they may face:

1.  **Astrogation Challenges:** Plotting interstellar courses demands advanced astrogation accounting for factors like star locations, gravity wells, hyperspace corridors and jump points. Navigation checks determine trajectory accuracy and efficiency.

2.  **Gravity Slingshots:** Using a celestial body’s gravity can multiply a ship’s velocity. Characters must identify opportunities for gravity slingshots and execute complex maneuvers.

3.  **Hazardous Regions:** Certain areas teem with dangers like radiation clouds, asteroid fields or spatial anomalies. Characters must navigate around or shield against these threats.

4.  **Celestial Obstacles:** Ships may encounter rogue comets, debris fields or other stellar obstacles requiring evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions.

Characters skilled in astrogation, astrometrics and hyperspace physics will better overcome these challenges through calculation mastery and maneuver expertise.

### Random Interstellar Encounter Table

Roll 2d6 to determine a random encounter:

1.  **Spatial Anomaly:** The ship encounters strange phenomena like subspace eddies, gravitational lensing or radiation spikes requiring emergency navigation.

2.  **Distress Signal:** Characters receive a distress call they can investigate for trade, rescue or danger.

3.  **Debris Field:** The ship must navigate a field of ancient wreckage or technological debris, avoiding collisions.

4.  **Derelict Hulk:** Characters discover an abandoned alien craft, a chance for salvage or discovery of lost archeotech.

5.  **Astrogation Failure:** Systems experience a temporary astrogation failure, forcing manual navigation to get back on course.

6.  **Asteroid Hazard:** The ship traverses an asteroid belt requiring precision maneuvers to avoid destructive impacts.

7.  **Subspace Rift:** A rift or wormhole aperture appears, offering a shortcut or gateway to the unknown.

8.  **Pirate Ambush:** Hostile ships attempt to intercept, board or disable the characters’ vessel requiring evasion or combat.

9.  **Trade Opportunity:** Characters encounter a trader convoy offering a chance to barter for rare goods or intel.

10. **Celestial Phenomenon:** A rare stellar event like a pulsar flare or comet’s passing presents awe or research opportunities.

11. **Alien Artifact:** The ship’s sensors detect a drifting alien artifact of potentially immense value or power.

Interstellar voyages demand exceptional astrogation skills, quick reactions and courage to overcome navigation perils and strange encounters lurking in the cosmic void between stars.

## Travel Time and Fuel Consumption

Interstellar travel in this universe requires careful planning and resource management. Two main methods exist - conventional interplanetary travel within star systems, and utilization of the rare and precious jumpgate technology to traverse between neighboring systems.

### Interplanetary Travel

For voyages within a single star system, spacecraft must rely on conventional propulsion technology like fusion torches and Ion engines. These provide high levels of acceleration over long periods, but are still bound by the limits of relativistic physics.

Travel times between planets in a system can take weeks or months depending on the distances involved. A trip from Earth to the orbit of Neptune in our Solar system could take over 8 months with continuous acceleration and deceleration.

Fuel requirements scale with the mass of the spacecraft and desired acceleration rates. A large cargo hauler may require thousands of tons of fuel for an interplanetary journey, while efficient exploration craft can make do with far less.

Key considerations: - Conventional interplanetary drives are reliable but sluggish - High acceleration rates are possible but consume exponentially more fuel - In-system resource extraction and refueling is often necessary - Travel times must account for months of acceleration and deceleration

### Jumpgate Technology

The pivotal invention of jumpgate technology revolutionized interstellar travel by allowing effective faster-than-light transit between star systems up to 15 light-years apart. Jumpgates are artificially sustained wormholes stabilized by rare minerals and immense industrial megastructures.

While passage through a jumpgate is nearly instantaneous, the gates themselves are incredibly rare. The handful of known stable jumpgates discovered so far connect wealthy inner spheres of human-occupied space.

Operating a jumpgate requires astronomical quantities of exotic matter and antimatter fuel sources. This ensures they remain under strict control of system authorities and powerful corporations.

Key limitations: - Only a few dozen jumpgates exist across inhabited space - Maximum range is 15 light-years between connected gates  
\- Transits are effectively instantaneous but consume huge resources - Undiscovered systems lack gate access entirely

Given the scarcity of jumpgates, most interstellar travel still relies on protracted conventional voyages at sub-light speeds. Even with gate access, in-system travel requires months of careful planning. Jumpgates are highly strategic assets, but do not fully alleviate the challenges and perils of interstellar exploration and resource logistics in this universe.

## Environmental Hazards

Environmental Hazards play a significant role in *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, emphasizing the harsh realities and challenges of space colonization. Characters will encounter a range of hazards that pose risks to their well-being and mission success. These hazards include radiation exposure, microgravity environments, extreme temperatures, and the scarcity of resources. Mechanisms are in place to address these challenges and ensure the characters’ survival and progress in the game.

### Radiation Exposure

Space is filled with various forms of radiation that can be harmful to humans and equipment. Characters must navigate through regions with higher radiation levels cautiously, utilize radiation shielding materials and equipment to minimize exposure, and monitor radiation levels to avoid long-term health effects. The Referee may introduce radiation events or zones that require characters to make decisions regarding their routes, resource allocation for shielding, or even engaging in special missions to repair or secure radiation shielding on structures or spacecraft.

### Microgravity Environments

In microgravity conditions, characters experience weightlessness, which can affect their physical capabilities and equipment. Characters must adapt to the challenges of moving, performing tasks, and manipulating objects in a microgravity environment. They may require specialized training or equipment, such as magnetic boots or handheld propulsion devices, to maintain stability and maneuver effectively. The Referee can introduce skill checks or mechanics to simulate the unique physics of microgravity, adding an additional layer of complexity to character actions and decision-making.

### Extreme Temperatures

The vastness of space brings extreme temperature variations, from freezing cold to scorching heat. Characters must prepare for these extreme temperatures by wearing appropriate environmental suits, utilizing temperature regulation systems, and ensuring proper insulation in their habitats and vehicles. Failure to manage temperature extremes can lead to equipment malfunctions, damage to life support systems, or even life-threatening conditions for characters. The Referee can introduce mechanics for monitoring temperature levels, making temperature-related skill checks, or incorporating events where characters must deal with unexpected temperature fluctuations.

### Scarcity of Resources

Resources in space are limited, and characters must face the challenges of managing and rationing essential supplies such as oxygen, water, food, and energy. The scarcity of resources adds an additional layer of tension and decision-making to the game. Characters may need to engage in resource acquisition missions, establish mining operations, or trade with other factions to secure the necessary supplies for survival and mission objectives. The Referee can implement resource management mechanics, encounters related to resource scarcity, or events that test characters’ ability to make tough choices regarding resource allocation.

### Environmental Suits and Scientific Equipment

Environmental suits provide protection against the harsh space environments, including temperature extremes, radiation, and micrometeoroids. Characters must have access to and maintain environmental suits to venture outside habitats or spacecraft. Additionally, scientific equipment such as spectrometers, telescopes, or microscopes allow characters to gather valuable data, conduct experiments, and make discoveries. These tools are essential for scientific research and can provide insights into the environment, resources, and potential threats.

# The Age of Expansion

By the late 21st century, humanity had outgrown its cradle. The solar system became our new frontier, its planets and moons transformed into battlegrounds of politics, innovation, and survival. What began as a struggle for autonomy among colonies evolved into the foundation of the Sol Union, a fragile unity in the face of the unknown.

The early experiments with wormholes cracked the door to interstellar exploration, but it was decades before the courage and technology existed to walk through it. As humanity reached new stars, it carried with it old tensions: the balance between control and freedom, preservation and exploitation. The colonies of the “frontier” grew restless, and the systems closer to Sol wrestled with their own evolving identity.

When alien ruins were discovered in 2295, they shattered the illusion that humanity was alone. Though their builders were long gone, the ruins whispered of civilizations far older and more advanced. This revelation lit a fire beneath humanity’s ambitions, pushing us further into the void—not just to settle, but to understand.

From a fragile beginning to an expanding web of stargates and alliances, this era defined what it meant to be human in a universe where the stars were no longer out of reach.

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is the direct sequel to *Sol: Beyond Earth*

CC BY-SA 4.0 \# Frontier: Beyond Sol

Under the ghostly glow of SZ Ursae Majoris’ seventh planet, a cold martian giant, the small, stealthy vessel *Nimbus* held its position, nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding space debris. Inside, a team of Sol Union operatives prepared for a mission that tread the line between diplomacy and covert action in the uncharted reaches of space.

“Visuals up. We’re going in silent, but ready for anything,” Captain Elena Reyes instructed, her voice calm but carrying an undercurrent of anticipation. The *Nimbus* was a shadow against the planet’s icy rings, ready to deploy its team to a hidden base suspected of harboring technology that could shift the power dynamics within the Union.

Zan, her second-in-command, scanned the data streaming on his screen. “Approach vector locked. We’re ghosting through their scanners.”

In the dim light of the command deck, Ila, their communications and tech expert, piped up, “Jamming signals ready. We’ll be in and out before they know it.”

Elena nodded, turning to the rest of her crew. “This isn’t just about the tech. It’s about sending a message. We do this right, we could be paving the way for a new era of cooperation — or confrontation.”

Tarek, the team’s engineer, adjusted his gear, a mix of excitement and focus on his face. “Let’s make sure it’s cooperation then. I didn’t tweak these suits for nothing.”

A soft chuckle ran through the crew, easing the tension. Lian, who had been studying the planet’s atmospheric readings, added, “Remember, we’re not just operatives. We’re ambassadors. Every action reflects on the Sol Union.”

As the *Nimbus* neared the drop point, Elena shared a final glance with her team. “We all know the stakes. Let’s show them what the Sol Union stands for.”

The operatives moved towards the airlock, their suits equipped with the latest in stealth and environmental technology. As the outer door opened, revealing the vast, silent expanse of space, Zan muttered under his breath, a hint of humor in his voice, “Ambassadors with style, at least.”

One by one, they stepped into the void, their figures swallowed by the darkness as they made their silent approach to the hidden base, a speck of light against the infinite canvas of space.

# What is Frontier: Beyond Sol

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* is a roleplaying game in which you will define an imagined space bounded by rules. Actions and events occur through procedure-driven player interaction. This facilitates an emergent shared narrative.

Put plainly, players will assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. The characters will act according to the rules of the game that will guarantee their success or failure. The outcome of actions will have an effect on the narrative that emerges.

A game of *Frontier: Beyond Sol* takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the other players.

  - The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing Characters.
  - The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out their Character or play them impersonally. Players should also ask questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:

  - At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal number of players is 4-5 players, maximum 6.
  - A complete set of polyhedral dice, preferably one for each player.
  - Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the following principles in mind:

  - **Fiction over mechanics.** This ruleset is intentionally streamlined and prioritizes fiction over complex mechanics. If you are primarily interested in a game with detailed mechanical systems, there are other rulesets that may be better suited to your preferences.
  - **The Referee is a player.** Although the Referee has different responsibilities than the other players, they should still be considered as a fellow player and should not shoulder more responsibility for the success of the game than anyone else at the table.
  - **Referee’s Mediating Role.** The Referee does not compete against other players; their role is solely to arbitrate situations within the context of the game. They are responsible for maintaining consistency, ensuring fairness, and resolving any disputes or conflicts that may arise during play.
  - **Promote Cooperative Play.** This game is intended to be played collaboratively, with a focus on teamwork and overcoming challenges as a group. As such, competition between players should be discouraged in favor of cooperation and mutual support. The characters should work together to confront the obstacles and threats posed by the game world, rather than engaging in individualistic or adversarial behavior.
  - **Information Query.** Players should ask the Referee questions in a concise and straightforward manner. The Referee, in turn, should provide clear and detailed explanations of the context and the potential risks associated with each action taken by the characters. This helps to ensure that players make informed decisions and understand the consequences of their actions.
  - **Action first.** When describing an action, players should first provide a clear and detailed description of what their character is attempting to do. Only after the action has been fully described should the Referee request a dice roll, if necessary, to determine the outcome of the action. This helps to ensure that the narrative flows smoothly and that players have a clear understanding of the sequence of events.
  - **Emergent Fiction.** The game thrives on emergent fiction, where the narrative evolves naturally from player choices and interactions. Be prepared for unexpected twists and developments, and allow the story to unfold organically based on the characters’ actions and decisions. Embrace the creativity and spontaneity that arise from collaborative storytelling, and don’t be afraid to deviate from preconceived notions of how the plot should progress.
  - **Embrace uncertainty.** Embracing uncertainty is at the core of this game. Embrace the unpredictability of player choices and the twists and turns the narrative may take. Avoid rigidly planning every detail and be open to adapting to the unexpected. This willingness to embrace uncertainty can lead to some of the most memorable and engaging moments in the game, so relish the uncertainty and let it guide the storytelling.

## A word about “realism”

In playing *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, it is important to embrace a sense of realism that remains consistent with the game’s setting, backgrounds, equipment, and accompanying illustrations. This hard sci-fi universe is designed to inspire players and immerse them in a believable and captivating experience. While it is not mandatory to have prior knowledge of the specific science fiction genre or to read the sources of inspiration, doing so can deepen the appreciation for the game’s intricacies. While true “realism” is impossible in a fictional game, it is crucial to avoid indulging in absurdities and instead strive for consistency with the established setting and adhere to general principles of physics. By embracing this approach, players can engage in an authentic and immersive gaming experience that respects the established rules and allows for a compelling and plausible narrative to unfold.

## Safety Tools

It is important to remember that not everyone at the table may be comfortable with the themes or content addressed by the game, or with the actions of the other players. It is therefore important to establish clear boundaries and expectations at the beginning of the game, and to be sensitive to the needs and feelings of all participants throughout the session. It may also be helpful to establish a system for communicating discomfort or taking breaks if needed.

There are various safety tools and techniques that can help create a comfortable and safe environment for everyone involved in the game, such as [Lines And Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean), [C.A.T.S.](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/), the [X-Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit?usp=sharing), and [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/).

It is important to familiarize yourself with these tools and techniques and to use them proactively to ensure that everyone feels safe and comfortable during the game.

# How to play

The role of the Referee is to control the game universe: he describes situations, NPCs, and their reactions to the PCs’ actions. He or she should be as clear as possible about the conditions of the context in which the characters are immersed: if there is a reasonable certainty that the character has access to a piece of information or knowledge, the referee should communicate it to the player, without asking for a roll. In this game, a roll is made only for situations of risk or uncertainty of the outcome of a direct action.

  - If an action is impossible, the referee simply declares it so by explaining why and describing the possible alternatives to the player.
  - If the cost of an action is explicit, the referee will clearly present it. The player can decide whether to take the action or try another one.
  - If the action involves a risk, the referee will communicate this clearly. The player will be able to make informed decisions about the action they want to take and they will pull to determine the outcome.

In all other cases, the action is automatically successful.

## Rolling

When a character attempts an action with significant risk, the player rolls a skill die to determine the outcome. The default is a d6.

  - If the character has applicable skills or talents, they roll a bigger die like d8 or d10 to represent competence.
  - Conversely, if *hindered* by injuries or obstacles may warrant a smaller die like d4 to show impairment.

The player can also roll bonus dice based on circumstances:

  - Favorable conditions grant an extra d6 die. Things like having the high ground in combat or proper tools for a repair task.
  - An ally who helps adds their own skill die to the roll, representing combined effort. The ally shares in any risk.

The player rolls their skill die plus any bonus dice, taking the single highest result.

  - **1-2, disaster.** The full brunt of the risk occurs, and the Referee judges if there is any success at all. A roll this bad could mean instant death when mortality is on the line.
  - **3-4, setback.** You suffer a lesser or partial consequence. If risking death, the character might survive but with a grievous injury and *hindered*.
  - **5+, success.** The higher numbers, the better the outcomes.

The core mechanic balances risk versus reward, with competence and teamwork aiding success. But dire consequences are still possible, maintaining high drama and tension.

## Load

Characters can carry as many possessions as reasonably fits their physical capacity and the storage space on their person. For example, a character could carry a weapon, some tools, and a backpack containing rations and other useful adventuring gear.

However, if a character loads themselves down with multiple overly bulky or heavy items, it may hinder their ability to move and act freely at times. For instance, carrying a large shield, a two-handed weapon, and a bulging sack of gear may make it difficult to squeeze through narrow spaces or balance while climbing.

In such cases, the referee will inform the player that their character’s encumbrance is \_hindering \_their movement or dexterity in the current situation. The player can then decide to temporarily set down some of their carried items to proceed unfettered, stowing the extra gear nearby to be retrieved later. Or they may opt to continue carrying everything, accepting additional challenges or risks to their intended actions.

## Advancement

After successfully completing a mission or major story milestone, each player character will improve in the following ways as a reward for their accomplishments:

  - Increase one of their skill ranks by one step on the progression track (none → d8 → d10 → d12). This represents honing their competencies through experience.
  - Gain a number of currency credits (₡) equal to a d6 roll. Credits can be spent to acquire new gear, weapons, cyberware, services, etc. The die roll result encourages uncertainty in the exact amount of new wealth obtained.

For example, after infiltrating an enemy base undetected and stealing valuable data, a character with stealth and hacking skills currently at d8 could increase their stealth to d10 for greater sneaking ability. They also would gain somewhere between 1-6 credits to spend on desired upgrades and purchases.

This dual progression system rewards both new capabilities and resources, allowing characters to become more powerful and versatile over the course of the campaign. The incremental upgrades create a satisfying sense of growth and advancement for each successful mission. But the unpredictability keeps material gain uncertain, maintaining long-term goals and motivation.

## Damage Control

Say how you use a piece of gear to absorb damage. It’s disabled until repaired at a base.

When a character is about to take damage from an attack or hazard, the player can describe how they utilize a piece of equipment to absorb some or all of the incoming damage. This could involve actions like raising a shield to block an incoming blow, using a large tool as cover from an explosion, or angling a vehicle to have an attack hit a reinforced section.

After being used to soak damage this way, that gear becomes disabled and non-functional until it can be repaired back at a home base or facility with the proper tools and parts.

The referee will determine if using the gear fully negates the attack or just reduces the damage taken. More powerful or intense attacks may overwhelm a piece of gear’s protection capacity.

## Injuries

If a character sustains a serious injury during a game session, they will need to spend some in-game time in the medical bay to recover. The player should describe their character receiving medical treatment and the referee can narrate the passage of time during the healing process.

If a character is killed, the player should introduce a new character as soon as is practical. The referee should facilitate quickly integrating the new character into the ongoing story.

When adjudicating the effects of injuries or character death, inclusion of the affected player takes priority over adhering to strict realism. The referee should aim to avoid excluding a player from participation due to their character being incapacitated. Workarounds like having the player take temporary control of a supporting character can help keep everyone involved.

The risks of combat and other dangerous activities are an important part of the game’s drama and stakes. However, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have fun together. So when serious consequences occur, the referee should guide the narrative in a direction that returns the affected player to active participation in a seamless, collaborative manner.

## Game mastering

The referee portrays non-player characters (NPCs) by describing their behaviors, motivations, and obstacles they present to the player characters. The referee should lead the group in establishing boundaries for subject matter and conduct during play.

To control pacing and safety, the referee can fast-forward through uneventful stretches, pause play for breaks or sidebar discussions, or even rewind and redo a scene if needed. The referee should invite players to request scene edits too.

The referee should present dilemmas and challenges without pre-planned solutions, allowing the players to drive the direction of the story through their choices.

To give everyone screen time, the referee moves the spotlight around, checking in with each player in turn.

To inject randomness and chaos, the referee can occasionally test for bad luck by rolling a die - a 1-2 means trouble occurs, like running out of ammo at a bad time or stumbling into patrolling guards. A 3-4 indicates signs of impending trouble.

When the written rules don’t adequately cover a situation, the referee improvises rulings in the moment to keep the game moving. If any rulings seem unsatisfactory, the group should discuss them on a break and revise them collaboratively.

The referee portrays the world and inhabitants surrounding the player characters. By sharing narrative power while guiding pacing and monitoring safety, the referee enables the group to collectively build an exciting and satisfying story.

# Interstellar Travel

Interstellar travel in this universe is not only about reaching distant star systems but also about managing resources, calculating travel times through hyperspace corridors or wormholes, and facing unexpected encounters along the journey. The advanced propulsion systems and starships available offer a range of options, each with its own capabilities and limitations.

As you traverse the vastness of interstellar space, be prepared for the unexpected. Navigation hazards, random anomalies, and dangerous encounters may test your skills and decision-making. Whether negotiating with alien civilizations, repairing hyperdrives, or avoiding cosmic phenomena, your voyages will be filled with peril and wonder.

## Navigation Hazards

Navigating across interstellar distances presents unique challenges requiring precise calculations and skillful execution. Characters must navigate gravitational forces, celestial bodies, radiation hazards, and the complexities of hyperspace/wormhole travel to reach destinations safely.

During journeys, they may face:

1.  **Astrogation Challenges:** Plotting interstellar courses demands advanced astrogation accounting for factors like star locations, gravity wells, hyperspace corridors and jump points. Navigation checks determine trajectory accuracy and efficiency.

2.  **Gravity Slingshots:** Using a celestial body’s gravity can multiply a ship’s velocity. Characters must identify opportunities for gravity slingshots and execute complex maneuvers.

3.  **Hazardous Regions:** Certain areas teem with dangers like radiation clouds, asteroid fields or spatial anomalies. Characters must navigate around or shield against these threats.

4.  **Celestial Obstacles:** Ships may encounter rogue comets, debris fields or other stellar obstacles requiring evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions.

Characters skilled in astrogation, astrometrics and hyperspace physics will better overcome these challenges through calculation mastery and maneuver expertise.

### Random Interstellar Encounter Table

Roll 2d6 to determine a random encounter:

1.  **Spatial Anomaly:** The ship encounters strange phenomena like subspace eddies, gravitational lensing or radiation spikes requiring emergency navigation.

2.  **Distress Signal:** Characters receive a distress call they can investigate for trade, rescue or danger.

3.  **Debris Field:** The ship must navigate a field of ancient wreckage or technological debris, avoiding collisions.

4.  **Derelict Hulk:** Characters discover an abandoned alien craft, a chance for salvage or discovery of lost archeotech.

5.  **Astrogation Failure:** Systems experience a temporary astrogation failure, forcing manual navigation to get back on course.

6.  **Asteroid Hazard:** The ship traverses an asteroid belt requiring precision maneuvers to avoid destructive impacts.

7.  **Subspace Rift:** A rift or wormhole aperture appears, offering a shortcut or gateway to the unknown.

8.  **Pirate Ambush:** Hostile ships attempt to intercept, board or disable the characters’ vessel requiring evasion or combat.

9.  **Trade Opportunity:** Characters encounter a trader convoy offering a chance to barter for rare goods or intel.

10. **Celestial Phenomenon:** A rare stellar event like a pulsar flare or comet’s passing presents awe or research opportunities.

11. **Alien Artifact:** The ship’s sensors detect a drifting alien artifact of potentially immense value or power.

Interstellar voyages demand exceptional astrogation skills, quick reactions and courage to overcome navigation perils and strange encounters lurking in the cosmic void between stars.

## Travel Time and Fuel Consumption

Interstellar travel in this universe requires careful planning and resource management. Two main methods exist - conventional interplanetary travel within star systems, and utilization of the rare and precious jumpgate technology to traverse between neighboring systems.

### Interplanetary Travel

For voyages within a single star system, spacecraft must rely on conventional propulsion technology like fusion torches and Ion engines. These provide high levels of acceleration over long periods, but are still bound by the limits of relativistic physics.

Travel times between planets in a system can take weeks or months depending on the distances involved. A trip from Earth to the orbit of Neptune in our Solar system could take over 8 months with continuous acceleration and deceleration.

Fuel requirements scale with the mass of the spacecraft and desired acceleration rates. A large cargo hauler may require thousands of tons of fuel for an interplanetary journey, while efficient exploration craft can make do with far less.

Key considerations: - Conventional interplanetary drives are reliable but sluggish - High acceleration rates are possible but consume exponentially more fuel - In-system resource extraction and refueling is often necessary - Travel times must account for months of acceleration and deceleration

### Jumpgate Technology

The pivotal invention of jumpgate technology revolutionized interstellar travel by allowing effective faster-than-light transit between star systems up to 15 light-years apart. Jumpgates are artificially sustained wormholes stabilized by rare minerals and immense industrial megastructures.

While passage through a jumpgate is nearly instantaneous, the gates themselves are incredibly rare. The handful of known stable jumpgates discovered so far connect wealthy inner spheres of human-occupied space.

Operating a jumpgate requires astronomical quantities of exotic matter and antimatter fuel sources. This ensures they remain under strict control of system authorities and powerful corporations.

Key limitations: - Only a few dozen jumpgates exist across inhabited space - Maximum range is 15 light-years between connected gates  
\- Transits are effectively instantaneous but consume huge resources - Undiscovered systems lack gate access entirely

Given the scarcity of jumpgates, most interstellar travel still relies on protracted conventional voyages at sub-light speeds. Even with gate access, in-system travel requires months of careful planning. Jumpgates are highly strategic assets, but do not fully alleviate the challenges and perils of interstellar exploration and resource logistics in this universe.

## Environmental Hazards

Environmental Hazards play a significant role in *Frontier: Beyond Sol*, emphasizing the harsh realities and challenges of space colonization. Characters will encounter a range of hazards that pose risks to their well-being and mission success. These hazards include radiation exposure, microgravity environments, extreme temperatures, and the scarcity of resources. Mechanisms are in place to address these challenges and ensure the characters’ survival and progress in the game.

### Radiation Exposure

Space is filled with various forms of radiation that can be harmful to humans and equipment. Characters must navigate through regions with higher radiation levels cautiously, utilize radiation shielding materials and equipment to minimize exposure, and monitor radiation levels to avoid long-term health effects. The Referee may introduce radiation events or zones that require characters to make decisions regarding their routes, resource allocation for shielding, or even engaging in special missions to repair or secure radiation shielding on structures or spacecraft.

### Microgravity Environments

In microgravity conditions, characters experience weightlessness, which can affect their physical capabilities and equipment. Characters must adapt to the challenges of moving, performing tasks, and manipulating objects in a microgravity environment. They may require specialized training or equipment, such as magnetic boots or handheld propulsion devices, to maintain stability and maneuver effectively. The Referee can introduce skill checks or mechanics to simulate the unique physics of microgravity, adding an additional layer of complexity to character actions and decision-making.

### Extreme Temperatures

The vastness of space brings extreme temperature variations, from freezing cold to scorching heat. Characters must prepare for these extreme temperatures by wearing appropriate environmental suits, utilizing temperature regulation systems, and ensuring proper insulation in their habitats and vehicles. Failure to manage temperature extremes can lead to equipment malfunctions, damage to life support systems, or even life-threatening conditions for characters. The Referee can introduce mechanics for monitoring temperature levels, making temperature-related skill checks, or incorporating events where characters must deal with unexpected temperature fluctuations.

### Scarcity of Resources

Resources in space are limited, and characters must face the challenges of managing and rationing essential supplies such as oxygen, water, food, and energy. The scarcity of resources adds an additional layer of tension and decision-making to the game. Characters may need to engage in resource acquisition missions, establish mining operations, or trade with other factions to secure the necessary supplies for survival and mission objectives. The Referee can implement resource management mechanics, encounters related to resource scarcity, or events that test characters’ ability to make tough choices regarding resource allocation.

### Environmental Suits and Scientific Equipment

Environmental suits provide protection against the harsh space environments, including temperature extremes, radiation, and micrometeoroids. Characters must have access to and maintain environmental suits to venture outside habitats or spacecraft. Additionally, scientific equipment such as spectrometers, telescopes, or microscopes allow characters to gather valuable data, conduct experiments, and make discoveries. These tools are essential for scientific research and can provide insights into the environment, resources, and potential threats.

# The Age of Expansion

By the late 21st century, humanity had outgrown its cradle. The solar system became our new frontier, its planets and moons transformed into battlegrounds of politics, innovation, and survival. What began as a struggle for autonomy among colonies evolved into the foundation of the Sol Union, a fragile unity in the face of the unknown.

The early experiments with wormholes cracked the door to interstellar exploration, but it was decades before the courage and technology existed to walk through it. As humanity reached new stars, it carried with it old tensions: the balance between control and freedom, preservation and exploitation. The colonies of the “frontier” grew restless, and the systems closer to Sol wrestled with their own evolving identity.

When alien ruins were discovered in 2295, they shattered the illusion that humanity was alone. Though their builders were long gone, the ruins whispered of civilizations far older and more advanced. This revelation lit a fire beneath humanity’s ambitions, pushing us further into the void—not just to settle, but to understand.

From a fragile beginning to an expanding web of stargates and alliances, this era defined what it meant to be human in a universe where the stars were no longer out of reach.
