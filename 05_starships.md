## Combat

### Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise between factions during interplanetary travel, space combat mechanics can be used. Combat follows a similar structure to regular combat, with rounds and action sequences.

### Ship Attributes 

Spacecraft have their own functions, such as Hull, Weapons, Armor, and Propulsion. These determine the capabilities and effectiveness of the spacecraft in combat situations. The Referee can create a set of ship attributes or use pre-defined ship templates for ease of play.

### Ship Actions

During space combat, characters can take various ship actions, such as attacking with weapons, evasive maneuvers, deploying countermeasures, or targeting specific ship systems. The actions available depend on the ship's capabilities and the character's skills.

### Combat Rolls 

Combat rolls are used to determine the outcomes of attacks and defensive actions. These rolls take into account the attacker's skill, ship attributes, and potential modifiers based on the situation. Damage inflicted on the target ship is calculated, considering the defender's armor and other defensive systems.

### Boarding Actions 

In addition to ship-to-ship combat, characters may engage in boarding actions, attempting to breach enemy ships and engage in close-quarters combat. Boarding actions follow similar rules to regular combat, with characters utilizing their skills and weapons to overcome enemy forces.

### Consequences and Repairs 

Space combat can have long-lasting consequences, damaging ship systems and potentially causing critical failures. Characters must deal with the aftermath of combat, including repairing their ships, tending to injured crew members, and managing limited resources in the hostile environment of space.
