# How to play

The role of the Referee is to control the game universe: he describes situations, NPCs, and their reactions to the PCs' actions. He or she should be as clear as possible about the conditions of the context in which the characters are immersed: if there is a reasonable certainty that the character has access to a piece of information or knowledge, the referee should communicate it to the player, without asking for a roll. In this game, a roll is made only for situations of risk or uncertainty of the outcome of a direct action.

- If an action is impossible, the referee simply declares it so by explaining why and describing the possible alternatives to the player.
- If the cost of an action is explicit, the referee will clearly present it. The player can decide whether to take the action or try another one.
- If the action involves a risk, the referee will communicate this clearly. The player will be able to make informed decisions about the action they want to take and they will pull to determine the outcome.

In all other cases, the action is automatically successful.

## Rolling

When a character attempts an action with significant risk, the player rolls a skill die to determine the outcome. The default is a d6. 

- If the character has applicable skills or talents, they roll a bigger die like d8 or d10 to represent competence. 
- Conversely, if _hindered_ by injuries or obstacles may warrant a smaller die like d4 to show impairment.

The player can also roll bonus dice based on circumstances:

- Favorable conditions grant an extra d6 die. Things like having the high ground in combat or proper tools for a repair task.
- An ally who helps adds their own skill die to the roll, representing combined effort. The ally shares in any risk.

The player rolls their skill die plus any bonus dice, taking the single highest result.

- **1-2, disaster.** The full brunt of the risk occurs, and the Referee judges if there is any success at all. A roll this bad could mean instant death when mortality is on the line.
- **3-4, setback.** You suffer a lesser or partial consequence. If risking death, the character might survive but with a grievous injury and _hindered_.
- **5+, success.** The higher numbers, the better the outcomes. 

The core mechanic balances risk versus reward, with competence and teamwork aiding success. But dire consequences are still possible, maintaining high drama and tension.

## Load

Characters can carry as many possessions as reasonably fits their physical capacity and the storage space on their person. For example, a character could carry a weapon, some tools, and a backpack containing rations and other useful adventuring gear.

However, if a character loads themselves down with multiple overly bulky or heavy items, it may hinder their ability to move and act freely at times. For instance, carrying a large shield, a two-handed weapon, and a bulging sack of gear may make it difficult to squeeze through narrow spaces or balance while climbing.

In such cases, the referee will inform the player that their character's encumbrance is _hindering _their movement or dexterity in the current situation. The player can then decide to temporarily set down some of their carried items to proceed unfettered, stowing the extra gear nearby to be retrieved later. Or they may opt to continue carrying everything, accepting additional challenges or risks to their intended actions.

## Advancement

After successfully completing a mission or major story milestone, each player character will improve in the following ways as a reward for their accomplishments:

- Increase one of their skill ranks by one step on the progression track (none → d8 → d10 → d12). This represents honing their competencies through experience.
- Gain a number of currency credits (₡) equal to a d6 roll. Credits can be spent to acquire new gear, weapons, cyberware, services, etc. The die roll result encourages uncertainty in the exact amount of new wealth obtained.

For example, after infiltrating an enemy base undetected and stealing valuable data, a character with stealth and hacking skills currently at d8 could increase their stealth to d10 for greater sneaking ability. They also would gain somewhere between 1-6 credits to spend on desired upgrades and purchases.

This dual progression system rewards both new capabilities and resources, allowing characters to become more powerful and versatile over the course of the campaign. The incremental upgrades create a satisfying sense of growth and advancement for each successful mission. But the unpredictability keeps material gain uncertain, maintaining long-term goals and motivation.

## Damage Control

Say how you use a piece of gear to absorb damage. It's disabled until repaired at a base.

When a character is about to take damage from an attack or hazard, the player can describe how they utilize a piece of equipment to absorb some or all of the incoming damage. This could involve actions like raising a shield to block an incoming blow, using a large tool as cover from an explosion, or angling a vehicle to have an attack hit a reinforced section.

After being used to soak damage this way, that gear becomes disabled and non-functional until it can be repaired back at a home base or facility with the proper tools and parts.

The referee will determine if using the gear fully negates the attack or just reduces the damage taken. More powerful or intense attacks may overwhelm a piece of gear's protection capacity.

## Injuries

If a character sustains a serious injury during a game session, they will need to spend some in-game time in the medical bay to recover. The player should describe their character receiving medical treatment and the referee can narrate the passage of time during the healing process. 

If a character is killed, the player should introduce a new character as soon as is practical. The referee should facilitate quickly integrating the new character into the ongoing story.

When adjudicating the effects of injuries or character death, inclusion of the affected player takes priority over adhering to strict realism. The referee should aim to avoid excluding a player from participation due to their character being incapacitated. Workarounds like having the player take temporary control of a supporting character can help keep everyone involved.

The risks of combat and other dangerous activities are an important part of the game's drama and stakes. However, the ultimate goal is for everyone to have fun together. So when serious consequences occur, the referee should guide the narrative in a direction that returns the affected player to active participation in a seamless, collaborative manner.

## Game mastering

The referee portrays non-player characters (NPCs) by describing their behaviors, motivations, and obstacles they present to the player characters. The referee should lead the group in establishing boundaries for subject matter and conduct during play. 

To control pacing and safety, the referee can fast-forward through uneventful stretches, pause play for breaks or sidebar discussions, or even rewind and redo a scene if needed. The referee should invite players to request scene edits too.

The referee should present dilemmas and challenges without pre-planned solutions, allowing the players to drive the direction of the story through their choices. 

To give everyone screen time, the referee moves the spotlight around, checking in with each player in turn.

To inject randomness and chaos, the referee can occasionally test for bad luck by rolling a die - a 1-2 means trouble occurs, like running out of ammo at a bad time or stumbling into patrolling guards. A 3-4 indicates signs of impending trouble.

When the written rules don't adequately cover a situation, the referee improvises rulings in the moment to keep the game moving. If any rulings seem unsatisfactory, the group should discuss them on a break and revise them collaboratively. 

The referee portrays the world and inhabitants surrounding the player characters. By sharing narrative power while guiding pacing and monitoring safety, the referee enables the group to collectively build an exciting and satisfying story.

## Playing Solo

In a solo role-playing game, use these steps to guide your scenes:

1. **Set Expectations:** Think about your character's traits, goals, and motivations. Picture their action and how the game world might respond.  
2. **Test Expectations:** If you're unsure how the world reacts, ask the oracle a "Yes" or "No" question to gauge possible outcomes—advantages or setbacks.  
3. **Interpret the Outcome:** Compare the oracle's answer to your expectations. If it matches, proceed as planned. If it doesn't, think about how the unexpected result could shift the scene or story.  

Testing your assumptions keeps the game engaging and opens up fresh story possibilities.

When deciding outcomes for actions beyond your character's control or answering questions about the game world or NPC (Non-Player Character) reactions, try one of these methods:

1. **Draw a Conclusion:** Choose the answer that’s the most interesting or logical.  
2. **Ask a Closed Question:** Estimate the odds of a "Yes," then roll on the table below for the answer.  
3. **Choose Between Two Options:** Imagine two possible outcomes, mark one as "likely," and roll to see if it’s true. If not, go with the other option.  
4. **Spark an Idea:** Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

### Asking Questions

For closed questions (with a "Yes" or "No" answer), follow these steps:

1. Roll a die based on the likelihood:

| Likelihood         | Die to Roll |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Very Unlikely      | 1d4         |
| Unlikely           | 1d6         |
| Uncertain          | 1d6         |
| Likely             | 1d10        |
| Very Likely        | 1d12        |

2. Interpret the roll:  
   - **1-2 No, and...**: What you expected doesn’t happen, and things get worse.  
   - **3-4 Yes, but...**: What you expected happens, but with a complication.  
   - **5+ Yes, and...**: What you expected happens, plus something even better!  

3. Think about the answer in the context of your question and the situation. Does it fit? Does it inspire you?  
4. If you’ve got your answer, great! Play it out. If you need more details, use the Sparks tables for inspiration.  
5. If you’re still stuck, try rolling again, exploring a different Spark, or trust your instincts to move forward.

For open-ended questions, skip the oracle and roll directly on the Sparks tables. Let the results guide your imagination.

### Sparks

Use these tables to spark adventure ideas for *Frontier: Beyond Sol*. Combine an Action with a Theme to generate prompts like:  

- **"Investigate a signal in an uncharted star system."**  
- **"Defend an outpost from a hostile faction."**  
- **"Chart a stargate route through a debris field."**  
- **"Retrieve an ancient alien artifact buried in a ruin."**
