**Venture Beyond Sol and Into the Stars!**  

The year is 2400. Humanity’s boldest dream has come true: the stars are no longer out of reach. *Frontier: Beyond Sol* builds on the thriving world of *Sol: Beyond Earth*, where the solar system was humanity’s crucible. Now, the stargates of the Sol Union connect dozens of star systems, and humanity has claimed its place as a multi-planetary species.  

But exploration comes at a cost. The mysteries of ancient alien ruins, the fragile balance between core systems and frontier colonies, and the vast, unpredictable void of space challenge humanity’s resolve. You are an explorer, a diplomat, an engineer, or a soldier—your actions will shape humanity’s future among the stars.  

*Frontier: Beyond Sol* delivers streamlined mechanics and a richly detailed hard sci-fi setting for a new era of spacefaring adventure.  

- **A Galaxy Awaits**: Discover an interconnected network of star systems teeming with danger, opportunity, and ancient secrets.  
- **Your Role Among the Stars**: Choose from professions like Smuggler, Diplomat, Scientist, or Rockhopper, each with unique skills and gear to aid your journey.  
- **Hard Sci-Fi Meets Emergent Narrative**: Experience a believable future built on plausible technologies and collaborative storytelling.  
- **Frontier Tensions**: Navigate the politics of the Sol Union and its factions while exploring the uncharted frontier.  
- **From Earth to Infinity**: Continue the story begun in *Sol: Beyond Earth* and expand the timeline into the Age of Expansion.  

Inspired by the best of classic and modern sci-fi, *Frontier: Beyond Sol* invites you to step into a future where every decision matters, and the vast unknown beckons.
